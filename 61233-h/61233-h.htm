<h2 id="PREFACE_TO_THE_FIFTEENTH_EDITION">PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH EDITION.</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> First Edition of this work appeared in 1854, a time in the
history of the Microscope when the instrument, as an aid to
original scientific research, may be said to have been in its infancy.
Then certainly it was seldom employed in the laboratory or the
medical schools. Now, however, as I anticipated, it has asserted its
proper position, and has at length become one of the most important
auxiliaries to science, and a direct incentive to original work, while
it has doubtless exercised considerable influence over the student’s
power of observation, and materially assisted in his studies, let his
ultimate object and pursuits be what they may.</p>

<p>The greater use made of the Microscope has likewise conferred
benefits of untold value upon the arts and industries of the country,
thereby adding to the national prosperity in ways as manifold as
unique. The Microscope has also proved of immense value in the
promotion of the health of the community, and the art and science
of healing, since the theory of medicine has become a science, resting
on the minute microscopical examination of animal tissues.</p>

<p>The work of research in the sister sciences and by other methods
has, during the last decade, received a corresponding impetus, while
it has undoubtedly tended towards elaboration and specialisation in
all departments. In consequence, the progress of microscopical science
has become more dependent upon the specialist for gaining accurate
knowledge and for certain important details seen to be branching
out in many directions. There never was a time when the instrument
was so constantly and generally resorted to and with so much confidence
and advantage, as the present. It has shown itself equal to the
task imposed&mdash;that of teaching the eye to see things that are new,
and also, what is perhaps of more importance, to perceive things
which had been entirely overlooked. The older defects, perhaps,
arose from two causes; the want of more careful training of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
organ of vision, and the want of sufficient power and precision in the
optical part of the Microscope itself. Both of these obstacles have
been to a considerable extent removed, and all educational systems
are looked upon as incomplete without a knowledge of the Microscope.</p>

<p>A step has already been taken in another direction, that of furnishing
special forms of instruments, better adapted to the uses to
which they will hereafter be put, and purposely designed for chemical
and analytical processes, for petrological pursuits, the geometrical
measurement of crystals, for special work in connection with manufacturing
industries, for the dairyman, and the farmer. For the
detection of adulterations&mdash;that of butter, for example&mdash;a newer form
of instrument has been devised, namely, a “Butro-refractometer,”
by the help of which any adulteration of this universal article of
diet will at once be revealed. The form of instrument upon which
the optician has expended a greater amount of skill than perhaps on
any other is the Bacteriological Microscope, as may be inferred from
the larger space I have devoted to this important adjunct, since by
original research, there can be no doubt a still greater future is
in store for science in this special department of microscopy. But
perfect success in this direction remains very much with the practical
optician, and the further improvements made in the optical part
of the instrument, since it is admitted that the highest theoretical
perfection has not yet been reached.</p>

<p>It is a commonplace remark that every question solved is a step
towards new problems waiting solution. It is equally obvious that
many difficulties must be encountered by every author who uses his
best endeavours to supply a standard volume or even a fairly comprehensive
text-book on the Microscope, one that will remain a sure guide
for any lengthened period. Such a success I regard as scarcely possible.
I may, however, notice that my earlier work has met with a great
amount of appreciation, and its utility acknowledged in the past by
a demand almost unprecedented, edition after edition being called for.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add that my task has been accomplished
with an earnest desire to assist in diffusing a love for an instrument
which has been my constant companion for upwards of sixty years.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
Moreover, I have a firm conviction of the real utility of the Microscope
in the work of education, its practical value in many branches
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
of science, art, and manufacturing industries. These are my chief
reasons for applying myself once more to the task of revision, rewriting,
and rearranging and bringing this book as far as possible into line
with the knowledge gained in chemical pathology and bacteriology.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that in the first part, my subjects have as far
as possible been treated from a historical point of view. This method
has enabled me to affix dates of introduction of special inventions
and improvements made in the instrument and its appliances. The
enlargement of my pages has enabled me to devote more space to
bacteriological processes, and by the further addition of plates and
several hundred illustrations to more fully elucidate the subject
matter of my text. In an Appendix I have introduced a selection of
“Formul&aelig; and Methods” of staining, mounting, etc., also tables of
the “Metrical System,” now in general use in the laboratory;
together with comparative thermometric values, all of which I
trust may prove of service to the student.</p>

<p>Before bringing these few prefatory remarks to a close, a pleasing
duty devolves upon me&mdash;that of tendering my thanks for cordial aid
received from Professor Dr. <span class="smcap">Edgar Crookshank</span> in dealing with his
special subject, Bacteriology. From his valuable “Text-Book on
Bacteriology” I have extracted much useful matter. I am equally
indebted to Professor <span class="smcap">Marshall Ward</span>, F.R.S., Cambridge, for much
information on “Economic Botany,” and the great advances made in
the knowledge of the uses of plants, and the industrial value of
bacteria in particular. My acknowledgments are also due to the
Messrs. <span class="smcap">Warne</span> for many illustrations placed at my disposal, and
for useful facts derived from their “Royal Natural History.” It
will, however, be seen that the results of a large amount of independent
observation have been consigned to my pages. As the references
show, recourse has been had to original sources for trustworthy,
reliable information on many subjects. These are constantly, almost
daily, being added to, as is made manifest by the numerous periodical
publications of the day devoted to this and kindred sciences; the foremost
and most important among which is that almost exclusively given
to microscopical science, “The Journal of the Royal Microscopical
Society of London,” the perusal of which I commend to my readers.</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE_TO_THE_FIRST_EDITION">PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> Author of this Publication entered upon his task with some
hesitation and diffidence; but the reasons which influenced
him to undertake it may be briefly told, and they at once explain
his motives, and plead his justification, for the work which he
now ventures to submit to the indulgent consideration of his
readers.</p>

<p>It had been to him for some time a subject of regret that one
of the most useful and fascinating studies&mdash;that which belongs to
the domain of microscopic observation&mdash;should be, if not wholly
neglected, at best but coldly and indifferently appreciated by the
great mass of the general public; and he formed a strong opinion
that this apathy and inattention were mainly attributable to the
want of some concise, yet sufficiently comprehensive, <i>popular</i> account
of the Microscope, both as regards the management and manipulation
of the instrument, and the varied wonders and hidden realms of
beauty that are disclosed and developed by its aid. He saw around
him valuable, erudite, and splendid volumes, which, however, being
chiefly designed for circulation amongst a special class of readers,
were necessarily published at a price that renders them practically
unattainable by the great bulk of the public. They are careful and
beautiful contributions to the objects of science, but they do not
adequately bring the value and charm of microscopic studies home,
so to speak, to the firesides of the people. Day after day, new and
interesting discoveries, and amplifications of truth already discerned,
have been made, but they have been either sacrificed in serials, or,
more usually, devoted to the pages of class publications; and thus
this most important and attractive study has been, in a great
measure, the province of the few only, who have derived from it a
rich store of enlightenment and gratification: the many not having,
however, participated, to any great extent, in the instruction and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
entertainment which always follow in the train of microscopical
science.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>The manifold uses and advantages of the Microscope crowd
upon us in such profusion, that we can only attempt to enumerate
them in the briefest and most rapid manner in these prefatory
pages.</p>

<p>It is not many years since this invaluable instrument was
regarded in the light of a costly toy; it is now the inseparable
companion of the man of science. In the medical world, its utility
and necessity are fully appreciated, even by those who formerly
were slow to perceive its benefits; now, knowledge which could not
be obtained even by the minutest dissection is acquired readily by
its assistance, which has become as essential to the anatomist and
pathologist as are the scalpel and bedside observation. The smallest
portion of a diseased structure, placed under a Microscope, will tell
more in one minute to the experienced eye than could be ascertained
by long examination of the mass of disease in the ordinary method.
Microscopic agency, in thus assisting the medical man, contributes
much to the alleviation of those multiplied “ills which flesh is heir
to.” So fully impressed were the Council of the Royal College of
Surgeons with the importance of the facts brought to light in a
short space of time, that, in 1841, they determined to establish a
Professorship of Histology, and to form a collection of preparations
of the elementary tissues of both animals and vegetables, healthy
and morbid, which should illustrate the value of microscopical
investigations in physiology and medical science. From that time,
histological anatomy deservedly became an important branch of the
education of the medical student.</p>

<p>In the study of Vegetable Physiology, the Microscope is an indispensable
instrument; it enables the student to trace the earliest
forms of vegetable life, and the functions of the different tissues in
the growth of plants. Valuable assistance is derived from its agency
in the detection of adulterations. In the examination of flour, an
article of so much importance to all, the Microscope enables us to
judge of the size and shape of the starch-grains, their markings,
their isolation and agglomeration, and thus to distinguish the starch-grains
of one meal from those of another. It detects these and
other ingredients, invisible to the naked eye, whether combined in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
atoms or aggregated in crystals, which adulterate our food, our
drink, and our medicines. It discloses the lurking poison in the
minute crystallisations which its solutions precipitate. “It tells the
murderer that the blood which stains him is that of his brother, and
not of the other life which he pretends to have taken; and as a
witness against the criminal, it on one occasion appealed to the very
sand on which he trod at midnight.”</p>

<p>The zoologist finds in the Microscope a necessary coadjutor. To
the geologist it reveals, among a multiplicity of other facts, “that
our large coal-beds are the ruins of a gigantic vegetation; and the
vast limestone rocks, which are so abundant on the earth’s surface,
are the catacombs of myriads of animal tribes, too minute to be
perceived by the unaided vision.”</p>

<p>By “conducting the eye to the confines of the visible form,” the
Microscope proves an effective auxiliary in defining the geometric
properties of bodies. Its influence as an instrument of research
upon the structure of bodies has been compared to that of the
galvanic battery, in the hands of Davy, upon Chemistry. It detects
the smallest structural difference, heretofore inappreciable, and, as
an ally of Chemistry, enables us to discover the very small changes
of form and colour effected by test-fluids upon solids; and dissects
for us, so to speak, the most multiplex compounds. It opens out to
the mind an extended and vast tract, opulent in wonders, rich in
beauties, and boundless in extent.</p>

<p>The Microscope not only assists studies, and develops objects of
profound interest, but also opens up innumerable sources of entertainment
and amusement, in the ordinary conventional acceptation
of these terms; disclosing to us peculiarities and attractions in
abundance; impressing us with the wonderful and beautifully
skilful adaptation of all parts of creation, and filling our minds with
additional reverence and admiration for the beneficent and Almighty
Creator.</p>

<p>The Author will conclude these prefatory observations with a few
words in explanation of his arrangements, by way of dealing with
the instrument and development of his subject. He has sought, in the
volume that he now lays before the public, to point out and elucidate
at once in a practical manner and in a popular style, the vast fund
of utility and amusement which the Microscope affords, and has
endeavoured to touch upon most of the interesting subjects for
microscopic observation as fully as the restrictions of a limited space,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
and the nature of the succinct summary, would permit. To have
dwelt upon each in complete detail would have necessitated the issue
of many expensive volumes&mdash;and this would have entirely frustrated
the aim which the writer had in view; he has, therefore, contented
himself with the humble, but, he trusts, not useless, task of setting
up a finger-post, so to say, to direct the inquirer into the wider road.
In the section of the work devoted to the minuter portion of creation,
he has ventured to dwell somewhat longer, in the belief that that
department is more especially the province of the microscopist. He
has arranged his topics under special headings, and in separate
chapters, for the sake of perspicuity and precision; and has brought
the ever-welcome aid of illustration to convey his explanatory
remarks more vividly to the minds of his readers.</p>

<p>Finally, it is the Author’s hope that, by the instrumentality of
this volume, he may possibly assist in bringing the Microscope, and
its valuable and delightful studies, before the general public in a
more familiar, compendious, and economical form than he found
it at the period of its publication, so that, in these days of
a diffused taste for reading and the spread of cheap publications,
he may thus supply further exercise for the intellectual faculties;
contribute to the additional amusement and instruction of the family
circle, and aid the student of nature in investigating the wonderful
and exquisite works of the Almighty. If it shall be the good fortune
for this work, which is now confided with great diffidence to the
consideration of the public, to succeed, in however slight a degree,
in furthering this design, the Author will feel fully repaid for the
amount of time and labour expended.</p>

use, as explained by West&mdash;143. Ephydra riparia: left fore-foot, under-surface.
This fly is met with sometimes in immense numbers on the water in salt-marshes;
it has no power of climbing on glass, as seen by the structure
of the tenent hairs; the central tactile organ also is peculiar, the
whole acting as a float, one attached to each foot, enabling the fly to rest on

<h3 class="copy" id="Early_History_of_the_Microscope">Early History of the Microscope.</h3>

<p>The instrument known as the Microscope derives its designation from
two Greek words, μικρὸς (<i>mikros</i>), <i>small</i>, and σκοπέω (<i>skopeo</i>), <i>to see or
observe</i>; and is an optical instrument by means of which objects are so
magnified that details invisible or indistinct to the naked eye are clearly
seen. Its origin, so far as yet can be traced back, seems to be of a
doubtful nature. It is tolerably certain the ancients had little or no
conception of the magnifying power of lenses; this may be surmised
from their writings. The elder Pliny incidentally states that the
physicians of his day cauterised by means of “a globe of crystal.”
The learned Greek physician, Galen, however, demonstrates conclusively
that in the first and second centuries of our era the use of
magnifying lenses was quite unknown either to Greek or Roman.
Moreover, the writings of Archimedes, Ptolemy, and other learned
men, show that, although they had some idea of the action of refraction
at plane surfaces, as of water, yet of the refraction at curved
surfaces they had formed no conception. Indeed, they refer quite
indiscriminately to the spherical form, or the disc, or the plane
surface of the water, but not one of them speaks of the lenticular
form, or the curvature of their surfaces.</p>

<p>As to the more powerful optical instruments, the telescope and
microscope, although it would appear that Alhazen in the 10th or
11th century, Roger Bacon in the 13th, and Fracastoro and Baptist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
Porta in the 16th, had formed some idea that lenses might be made
and combined so that distant objects might be seen clearer, or near
ones magnified beyond the power of normal vision; yet we hold with
Kepler, that no instrument analogous to our telescope was known
before the early part of the 17th century.</p>

<p>The combination of lenses associated with the name of Galileo,
was, he tells us, of Dutch origin, and of a date anterior to that of
his telescope, constructed by him in 1609; and this would appear
to be the probable origin of the microscope consisting of a combination
of a convex object lens with a concave eye lens.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>It now appears almost impossible to assign the exact date of the
first production of the microscope (as distinguished from the simple
magnifying lens), but those who have made a special investigation,
agree that it must have been invented between 1590 and 1609, and
that either of the three spectacle-makers of Middelburg, Holland,
Hans Janssen, his son Zacharias Janssen, and Hans Lippershey, may
have been the inventor, the probabilities being in favour of the
Janssens, and there the question must remain.</p>

<p>The history of the modern microscope, like that of nations and
arts, has had its brilliant periods, in which it shone with uncommon
splendour, and was cultivated with extraordinary ardour; these
periods have been succeeded by intervals marked with no discovery,
and in which the science seemed to fade away, or at least to lie
dormant, till some favourable circumstance&mdash;the discovery of a new
object, or some new improvement in the instruments of observation&mdash;awakened
the attention of the curious, and reanimated the spirit
of research. Thus, soon after the invention of the microscope, the
field it presented to observation was cultivated by men of the first
rank in science, and who enriched almost every branch of natural
history by the discoveries made by means of this instrument.</p>

<h3>The Modern Microscope.</h3>

<p>To the celebrated Dr. Hooke belongs the honour of publishing an
account of the compound instrument in 1665 in his “Micrographia.”
His first claim, however, is founded on the application of a lamp
adjustable on a pillar, together with a glass globe of water and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
deep plano-convex condensing lens. By means of this arrangement,
he says, “The light can be directed more directly on the object under
examination.” In the further description given of his microscope,
he explains: “It has four draw-tubes for lengthening the body, and
a third lens to the optical combination.” This, it would appear, was
only brought into use when he wished to see the whole object at
once: “The middle-glass lens, conveying a very great company of
radiating pencils (of light) which would stray away; but when I had
occasion to examine the small parts of a body, I took out the middle
glass and made use of one eye-glass with the object-glass.”</p>

<p>From Hooke’s description I gather that he also introduced the
ball-and-socket movement into the construction of the body of his
instrument. This has found many imitators since his day; some of
them have gone so far as to claim the invention as one quite new. For
small accessories, where the leverage need not be considered, the ball-and-socket
has proved convenient enough; but not, however, if applied
to the stand of the microscope. Hooke, in his early work, expressed
dissatisfaction with the English-made lenses he had in use. He
complains of the “apertures of the object-glasses, which are so small
that very few rays are admitted; none will admit a sufficient
number of rays to magnifie the object beyond a determinate bigness.”
So we may take it that he thus early discovered the great importance
of an increase in the aperture of his microscope. Other improvements
of importance were made, and he was the first to describe a
useful method of estimating the magnifying power of his lenses, and
the difficulty of distinguishing between a prominence and a depression
in the object under investigation, which he was made more fully
aware of when preparing drawings for the illustration of his
“Micrographia Illustrata”; this would be in 1664, if not earlier.
His book created no little sensation on its first appearance, and it
soon became scarce. Hooke (says Mr. Mayall) “must undoubtedly
be credited with the first suggestion of immersion lenses.” Nevertheless,
in his “Lectures and Collections,” published in 1676, he
appears to be no longer enthusiastic over his double microscope, and
once more he reverts to the simpler instrument of his earlier days.
Whether this change of opinion was due to the publication of
Leeuwenhoek’s observations with his simple microscopes it is impossible
to say.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p>As early as 1673 Leeuwenhoek communicated some important
discoveries made by a simple microscope of his own construction to
the Royal Society; he, however, gave no particulars of the construction
of the instrument. Dr. Adams, writing to his friend (Sir) Hans Sloane,
says: “They appear to be spherules lodged between two plates of
gold or brass, in a hole whose diameter appears to be no bigger than
that of a small pin’s head.” At his death he bequeathed to the Royal
Society a cabinet containing twenty-six of these microscopes; the
cabinet and the microscopes long ago disappeared, but not before they
were carefully examined and described by Mr. Henry Baker, F.R.S.
In his report to the Royal Society, he says: “They consisted of a
series of convex-lenses, ranging in power from 1·20 to 1·5, and magnifying
from 160 to 40 diameters.” This must now be regarded as an
eventful period in the history of the microscope, since Leeuwenhoek’s
discoveries created a great sensation throughout Europe. And all
further improvements in compound instruments appear to have been
laid aside for some considerable period in consequence: and the
pocket instrument of Wilson, together with that of his scroll standard
(seen on the cover of this book), and which was one of the first
simple microscopes with a mirror mounted on the base in a line with
the optic axis.</p>

<p>The discoveries once more made, and at a much later period
(1738), by Dr. Nathaniel Lieberkuhn with his simple microscopes,
and by means of which he discovered the minute structure of the
mucous membrane of the alimentary canal, and which alone would
have immortalised his name had we not preserved in use to this day
an important adjunct of every modern instrument, the Lieberkuhn
reflector.</p>

<p>In the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,
there is a small cabinet of two drawers, containing a set of twelve
of his simple microscopes, each being provided with an original
injection. The form of the instrument is shown in Figs. 1 and 2.
<i>a b</i> represents a piece of brass tubing about an inch long and an
inch in diameter and provided with a cap at each extremity. The
one at <i>a</i> carries a small double-convex lens of half an inch focal
length; while at <i>b</i> there is fixed a condensing lens three-quarters of
an inch in diameter. In <a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a> the instrument is seen in section,
and explains itself. It is held by the handle in such a position
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
that the rays of light, from a lamp or a white cloud, may fall on
the condenser <i>b</i>, and concentrate on the speculum <i>l</i>. This again
further condenses the rays on the disc <i>c</i>, where
the object is held, and its adjustment made by the
milled-head screw <i>d</i>, so as to bring it within the
focus of the lens <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>From this digression I pass on to the evolution
of the compound microscope. The earliest workable
form known was that designed by Eustachio
Divini, who brought it to the notice of the Royal
Society in 1668. It consisted of two plano-convex
lenses, combined with their convex surfaces retained
in apposition. His idea was subsequently improved
upon by a London optician. Not long afterwards,
Philip Bonnani published an account of his improved
compound microscope; and we are certainly indebted
to him for two or more forms of the movable horizontal
microscopes, and for the compound condenser fitted
with focussing gear for illuminating transparent objects
by transmitted light. I must, however, pass by the
many changes made in the structure and form of the
instrument by the celebrated Dr. Culpeper, Scarlet,
Cuff, and many other inventors.</p>

<p><b>Benjamin Martin’s Microscope.</b>&mdash;Benjamin
Martin, about 1742, was busily engaged in making
improvements in the microscope, and I may say he was certainly
the first to provide accurate results for determining the exact
magnifying power of any object-lens, so that the
observer might state the exact amplification in a
certain number of diameters. He devised numerous
improvements in the mechanism and optical arrangements
of the instrument; the rack and pinion
focussing adjustments; the inclining movements to
the pillar carrying the stage; and the rectangular
mechanical motions to the stage itself. He was
familiar with the principles of achromatism, since
it appears he produced an achromatic objective about 1759, and he
is said to have sent an achromatic objective to the Royal Society
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
about that date. But an ingeniously constructed microscope by
Martin found its way to George the Third, the grandfather of our
Queen, and afterwards came into the possession of the late Professor
John Quekett, of the Royal College of Surgeons, who presented it
to the Royal Microscopical Society of London. This microscope will
ever associate Martin’s name with the earliest and best form of
the instrument, even should he not receive full recognition as the
inventor of the <i>achromatic microscope</i>.
On this account I introduce
a carefully made drawing of so
singularly perfect a form of the
early English microscope to the
notice of my readers. (<a href="#fig_3">Fig. 3</a>.)
The description given of it by the
late Professor Quekett is as follows:&mdash;“It
stands about two feet in
height, and is supported on a tripod
base, A; the central part of the
stem, B, is of triangular figure,
having a rack at the back, upon
which the stage, O, and frame, D,
supporting the mirror, E, are capable
of being moved up or down. The
compound body, F, is three inches
in diameter; it is composed of two
tubes, the inner of which contains
the eye-piece, and can be raised or
depressed by rack and pinion, so as
to increase or diminish the magnifying
power. At the base of the triangular bar is a cradle joint, G,
by which the instrument can be inclined by turning the screw-head,
H (connected with an endless screw acting upon a worm-wheel).
The arm, I, supporting the compound body, is supplied
with a rack and pinion, K, by which it can be moved backwards
and forwards, and a joint is placed below it, upon which the body
can be turned into the horizontal position; another bar, carrying
a stage and mirror, can be attached by a screw, L N, so as to convert
it into a horizontal microscope. The stage, O, is provided with all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
the usual apparatus for clamping objects, and a condenser can
be applied to its under surface; the stage itself may be removed,
the arm, P, supporting it, turned round on the pivot, C, and another
stage of exquisite workmanship placed in its stead, the under surface
of which is shown at Q.”</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_3" src="images/fig_3.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.&mdash;Martin’s Universal
Microscope. 1782.</p></div>

<p>This stage is strictly a micrometer one, having rectangular movements
and a fine adjustment, the movements being accomplished by
the fine-threaded screws, the milled heads of which are graduated.
The mirror, E, is a double one, and can be raised or depressed by
rack and pinion; it is also capable of removal, and an apparatus for
holding large opaque objects, such as minerals, can be substituted
for it. The accessory instruments are very numerous, and amongst
the more remarkable may be mentioned a tube, M, containing
a speculum, which can take the place of the tube, R, and so form
a reflecting microscope. The apparatus for holding animalcules or
other live objects, which is represented at S, as well as a plate of
glass six inches in diameter, with four concave wells ground in it,
can be applied to the stage, so that each well may be brought in
succession under the magnifying power. The lenses belonging
to this microscope are twenty-four in number; they vary in focal
length from four inches to one-tenth of an inch; ten of them are
supplied with Lieberkuhns. A small arm, capable of carrying
single lenses, can be supplied at T, and when turned over, the stage
of the instrument becomes a single microscope; there are four lenses
suitable for this purpose, their focal length varying from one-tenth
to one-fortieth of an inch. The performance of all the lenses is
excellent, and no pains appear to have been spared in their construction.
There are numerous other pieces of accessory apparatus,
all remarkable for the beauty of their workmanship.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>In addition to the movements described by Quekett, the body-tube
with its support can be moved in an arc concentrically with
the axis of the triangular pillar, on the top of which it is fitted with
a worm-wheel and endless-screw mechanism, actuated by the screw-head,
T, below. It must therefore be admitted that Martin led the
way far beyond his contemporaries, both in the design and the
evolution of the microscope. Furthermore, in his “New Elements
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
of Optics,” 1759, he dealt with the principle of achromatism, by
the construction of an achromatic telescope.</p>

<p>At a somewhat later period there lived in London a philosophical
instrument maker of some repute, George Adams, who published in
1746 a quarto book, entitled “Micrographia Illustrata, or the Knowledge
of the Microscope Explained.” This work fairly well describes
“the nature, uses, and magnifying powers of microscopes in general,
together with full directions how to prepare, apply, examine, and
preserve minute objects.” Adams’ book was the first of the kind
published in this country, and it contributed in no small degree to
the advancement of microscopical science. Adams writes: “We owe
the construction of the variable microscope to the ingenuity and
generosity of a noble person. The apparatus belonging to it is more
convenient, more certain, and more extensive than that of any other
at present extant; consequently, the advantage and pleasure
attending the observations in viewing objects through it must be
as extensive in proportion.” This is believed to apply to Martin’s
several microscopes, and that especially constructed for the king,
afterwards improved upon by Adams. Another early form of microscope,
Wilson Simple Scroll (1746), stamped on the cover of this
book, and has thus become familiar to microscopists, was also made
by Adams.</p>

<p>We now closely approach a period fertile in the improvement of
the microscope, and in the discoveries made by its agency. The
chief of those among the honoured names of the time we find
Trembley, Ellis, Baker, Adams, Hill, Swammerdam, Lyonet, Needham,
and a few others. Adams somewhat sarcastically observes
“that every optician exercises his talents in improving (as he calls
it) the microscope, in other words, in varying its construction and
rendering it different in form from that sold by his neighbour; or at
the best rendering it more complex and troublesome to manage.”
There were no doubt good reasons for these and other strictures
upon inventors as well as makers of microscopes, even in the Adams’
day. In the year 1787 the “Microscopical Essays” of his son were
published, in which he described all the instruments in use up to
that period.</p>

<p>Looking back, and taking a general survey of the work of nearly
two centuries in the history of the microscope, it cannot be said that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
either in its optical or mechanical construction any great amount of
progress was made. This in part may have arisen from the fact
that no pressing need was felt for either delicate focussing or higher
magnification. At all events, it was not until the application of
achromatism to the instrument that new life was infused into its
use, and a great impetus was given to its development, both
optically and mechanically.</p>

<p>In the year 1823 a strong desire became manifest for improved
forms of the instrument, in France by M. Selligue, by Frauenhofer
in Munich, by Amici in Modena, by M. Chevalier in Paris, and by
Dr. Goring, Mr. Pritchard, and Mr. Tully in London. The result
was that in 1824 a new form of achromatic object-glass was constructed
of nine-tenths of an inch focal length, composed of three
lenses, and transmitting a pencil of eighteen degrees; and which, as
regards accurate correction throughout the field, was for some years
regarded as perfect.</p>

<p>Sir David Brewster was the first to suggest the great importance
of introducing materials of a more highly refracting nature into the
construction of lenses. He wrote: “There can be no essential
improvement expected in the microscope unless from the discovery
of some transparent substance which, like the diamond, combines
a high refractive with a low dispersive power.” Having experienced
the greatest difficulty in getting a small diamond cut into a prism in
London, he did not conceive it practicable to grind, polish, and form
it into a lens.</p>

<p>Mr. Pritchard, however, was led to make the experiment, and on
the 1st of December, 1824, “he had the pleasure of first looking
through a diamond microscope.” Dr. Goring also tried its performance
on various objects, both as a single microscope and as an objective
of a compound instrument, and satisfied himself of its superiority
over other kinds of lenses. But here Mr. Pritchard’s labours did not
end. He subsequently found that the diamond used had many flaws
in it, which led him to abandon the idea of finishing it. Having
been prevented from resuming his operations on this refractory
material for a time he made a third attempt, and met with another
unexpected defect; he found that some lenses, unlike the first, gave
a double or triple image instead of a single one, in consequence of
some of their parts being either harder or softer than others. These
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
defects were found to be due to polarisation. Mr. Pritchard having
learned how to decide whether a diamond is fit for a magnifier or not,
subsequently succeeded in making two planoconvex lenses of
adamant; these proved to be perfect for microscopic purposes.
“One of these, of one-twentieth of an inch in focal length, is now
in the possession of his Grace the Duke of Buckingham; the other,
of one-thirtieth of an inch focus, is in his own hands.”</p>

<p>“In consequence of the high refracting power of a diamond lens
over a glass lens, the former material may be at least one-third
as thin as that of the latter, and if the focal length of both be equal,
say, one-eightieth of an inch, the magnifying power of the diamond
lens will be 2,133 diameters, whereas that of glass will be only 800.”
At a date (1812) before Brewster proposed diamond lenses he
demonstrated a simple method of rendering both single and compound
microscopes achromatic. “Starting,” he says, “with the
principle that all objects, however delicate, are best seen when
immersed in fluid, he placed an object on a slip of glass, and put
above a drop of oil, having a greater dispersive power than the single
concave lens, which formed the object-glass of the microscope. The
lens was then made to touch the fluid, so that the surface of the
fluid was formed into a concave lens, and if the radius of the outward
surface was such as to correct the dispersion, we should have a
perfect achromatic microscope.” Here we have the immersion
system foreshadowed. Shortly after these experiments of Brewster’s
were in progress, Dr. Goring is said to have discovered that the
structure of certain bodies could be readily seen in some microscopes
and not in others. These bodies he named test objects.
He then examined these tests with the achromatic combinations of
the Tullys, and was led to the discovery that “the penetrating
power of the microscope depends upon its angle of aperture.”</p>

<p>“While these practical investigations were in progress,” writes
Andrew Ross, “the subject of achromatism engaged the attention of
some of the most profound mathematicians in England, Sir John
Herschel, and Professors Airy and Barlow. Mr. Coddington and
others contributed largely to the theoretical examination of the subject;
and although the results of their labours were not applicable
to the microscope, they essentially promoted its improvement.”</p>

<p>About this period (1812) Professor Amici, of Modena, was experimentally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
engaged in the improvement of the achromatic object-glass,
and he invented a reflecting microscope superior to those of Newton,
Baker, or Smith, made as early as 1738, and long ago abandoned.
In 1815 Amici made further experiments, and introduced the immersion
system; while Frauenhofer, of Munich, about the same time
constructed object-glasses for the microscope of a single achromatic
lens, in which the two glasses, although placed in juxtaposition,
were not cemented together.</p>

<p>Dolland, it has been said, introduced achromatic lenses; but
although he constructed many achromatic telescopes, he did not
apply the same principle to microscopes, and those which he sold
were only modifications of the compound microscope of Cuff.</p>

<p>Dr. Wollaston employed a new form of combination in a microscope
constructed for his own use, and by which “he was able to see
distinctly the finest markings upon the scales of the <i>Lepisma</i> and
<i>Podura</i>, and upon those of the gnat’s wing.” His doublet is still
employed, and to which I shall refer under “Simple Microscopes.”</p>

<h3>Elementary Optics.</h3>

<p class="hang">Value of Inductive Science&mdash;Light: Its Propagation, Refraction, Reflection&mdash;Spherical
and Chromatic Aberrations&mdash;Human Eye, formation of Images
of External Objects in&mdash;Visual Angle increased&mdash;Abbe’s Theory of Microscopic
Vision.</p>

<p>The advances made in physics and mechanics during the 17th and
18th centuries fairly opened the way to the attainment of greater
perfection in all optical instruments. This has been particularly
exemplified with reference to the invention of the microscope, as
briefly sketched out in the previous chapter. Indeed, in the first
half of the present century the microscope can scarcely be said to
have held a position of importance among the scientific instruments
in frequent use. Since then, however, the zoologist and botanist by
its aid have laid bare the intimate structure of plants and animals,
and thereby have opened up a vast kingdom of minute forms of life
previously undreamt of; and in connection with chemistry a new
science has been founded, that of bacteriology.</p>

<p>For these reasons it will be of importance to the student of
microscopy to begin at the beginning, and it will be my endeavour
to introduce to his notice such facts in physical optics as are closely
associated with the formation of images, and, so to speak, systematise
such stepping stones for work hereafter to be accomplished.
Elementary principles only will be adduced, and without attempting
to involve my readers in intricate mathematical problems, and which
for the most part are unnecessary for the attainment of the object in
view. I therefore pass at once to the consideration of the propagation
of light through certain bodies.</p>

<p>The microscope, whether simple or compound, depends for its
magnifying power on the influence exerted by lenses in altering the
course of the rays of light passing through them being <small>REFRACTED</small>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
<i>Refraction</i> takes place in accordance with two well-known laws of
optics. When a ray of light passes from one transparent medium to
another it undergoes a change of direction at the surface of separation,
so that its course in the second medium makes an angle with
its course in the first. This change of direction is a resultant of
refraction. The broken appearance presented by a stick partly
immersed in water, and viewed in an oblique position, is an illustration
of the law of refraction. Liquids have a greater refractive
power than air or gases. As a rule, with some few exceptions, the
denser of the two substances has the greater refractive power;
hence it is customary in enumerating some of the laws of optics to
speak of the denser medium and
the rarer medium. The more correct
designation would be the
more refractive and the less refractive.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_4" src="images/fig_4.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;Law of Refraction.</p></div>

<p>Let R I (<a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a>) be a ray incident
at I on the surface of
separation of two media, and let
I S′ be the course of the ray after
refraction. Then the angles which
R I and I S make with the normal
are the <i>angle of incidence</i> and the
<i>angle of refraction</i> respectively,
and the first law of refraction is
that these angles lie in the same plane, or the <i>plane of refraction</i> is
the same as the <i>plane of incidence</i>. The law which connects the
magnitudes of these angles, and which was discovered by Snell,
a Dutch philosopher, can only be stated either by reference to
a geometrical construction, or by using the language of trigonometry.
Describe a circle about the point of incidence, I as
a centre, and drop perpendiculars from the points where it cuts
the rays on the normal. The law is that these perpendiculars,
R′ P′, S′ P, will have a constant ratio, or the sines <i>of the angles of</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
<i>incidence and refraction are in a constant ratio</i>; that is, so long as
the media through which the ray first passes, and by which it is
afterwards refracted, remain the same, and the light also of the same
kind, then it is referred to as the law of sines.</p>

<h3>Indices of Refraction.</h3>

<p>The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the
angle of refraction, when a ray passes from one medium to another
is termed the relative index of refraction. When a ray passes from
vacuum into any medium, this ratio is always greater than unity, and
is called the <i>absolute index of refraction</i>, or simply the index of
refraction for the medium in question.</p>

<p>The absolute index of air is so small that it may be neglected in
comparison with those of solids and liquids; but strictly speaking,
the relative index for a ray passing from air into a given substance
must be multiplied by the absolute index of the air, in order to
obtain the true index of refraction.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_5" src="images/fig_5.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.&mdash;Vision through a Glass Plate.</p></div>

<p><b>Critical Angle.</b>&mdash;It will be seen from the law of sines that, when
the incident ray is in the less refractive of the two media, to every
possible angle of incidence there
is a corresponding angle of
refraction. The angle referred
to is termed the <i>critical angle</i>,
and is readily computed if the
relative index of refraction be
given. When the media are air
and water, this angle is about
48&deg; 30′. For air and ordinary
kinds of glass its value varies
from 38&deg; to 41&deg;.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of total reflection may be observed in several
familiar instances. For example, if a glass of water, with a spoon in
it, is held above the level of the eye, the under side of the surface is
seen to shine like a mirror, and the lower part of the spoon is seen
reflected in it. Effects of the same kind are observed when a ray of
sunlight passes into an aquarium&mdash;on the other hand rays falling
normally on a uniform transparent plate of glass with parallel faces
keep their course; but objects viewed obliquely through the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
are displaced from their true position. Let S (<a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5</a>) be a luminous
point which sends light to an eye not directly opposite to it, on the
other side of a parallel plate. The emergent rays which enter the eye
are parallel to the incident rays; but as they have undergone lateral
displacement, their point of concourse is changed from S to S′, and
this is accordingly the image of S. The rays in such a case which
compose the pencil that enters the eye will not exactly meet in any
one point; there will be two focal lines, just as in the case of
spherical mirrors. The displacement produced, as seen in the
figure referred to above, increases with the thickness of the plate,
its index of refraction, and the obliquity of incidence. This
furnishes one of the simplest means of measuring the index of
refraction of a glass substance,
and is thus employed in Pichot’s
refractometer (“Deschanel”).</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_6" src="images/fig_6.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 6.&mdash;Refraction through a Prism.</p></div>

<p><b>Refraction through a
Prism.</b>&mdash;A prism is a portion
of a refracting medium bounded
by two plane surfaces, inclined
at a definite angle to one
another. The two plane surfaces
are termed the <i>faces</i> of
the prism, and their inclination
to one another is the refracting angle of the prism. A prism
preserves the property of bending rays of light from their original
course by refraction. A cylinder may be regarded as the limit of
a prism whose sides increase in number and diminish in size
indefinitely: it may also be regarded as a pyramid whose apex is
removed to an indefinite distance.</p>

<p>Let S I (<a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a>) be an incident ray in the plane of the principal
section of the prism. If the external medium be air, or other
substance of less refractive power than the prism, the ray on entering
the same will be bent nearer to the normal, taking such a course as
I E, and on leaving the prism will be bent away from the normal,
taking the course E B. The effect of these two refractions is, therefore,
to turn the ray away from the edge (or refracting angle)
of the prism. In practice, the prism is usually so placed that I E,
the path of the ray through the prism, makes equal angles with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
two faces at which refraction occurs. If the prism is turned very
far from this position, the course of the ray may be altogether
different from that represented in the figure; it may enter at one
face, be internally reflected at another, and come out at the third.</p>

<p>It is evident, therefore, that the minimum number of sides, <i>i.e.</i>,
the bounding faces, exclusive of the ends, which a prism can have
is three. In this form, it constitutes a most valuable instrument
of research in physical optics. A convex lens is practically merely
a curved form of two prisms combined, their bases being brought
into contact; on the other hand the concave lens is simply a reversal
of the position of the apices brought into contact, as shown in
<a href="#fig_11">Fig. 11</a>. Both convex and concave lenses are therefore closely
related to the prism.</p>

<p><b>Reflection.</b>&mdash;The laws that govern the change of direction which a
ray of light experiences when it strikes upon the surfaces of separation
of two media and is thrown back into the same medium from
which it approached is as follows:&mdash;When the reflecting surface is
plain the direction of the reflected ray makes with the normal to
the surface the same angle which the incident ray makes with the
same normal; or, as it is usually expressed, the angles of reflection
and incidence are equal. When the surfaces are curved the same
law holds good. In all cases of reflection the energy of the ray is
diminished, so that reflection must always be accompanied by
absorption. The latter probably precedes the former. Most bodies
are visible by light reflected from their surfaces, but before this
takes place the light has undergone a modification, namely, that
which imparts colour peculiar to the bodies viewed. When light
impinges upon the surface of a denser medium part is reflected, part
absorbed, and part refracted. But for a certain angle depending
upon the refractive index of the refracting medium no refraction
takes place. This angle is termed the angle of total reflection, since
all the light which is not absorbed is wholly reflected.</p>

<p>Multiple images are produced by a transparent parallel plate of
glass. If the glass be silvered at the back, as it usually is in the
microscope-mirror, the second image is brighter than the first, but as
the angle of incidence increases the first image gains upon the second;
and if the luminous object be a lamp or candle, a number of images,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
one behind the other, will be visible to an eye properly placed in
front. This is due to the fact that the reflecting power of a surface
of glass increases with the angle of incidence.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_7" src="images/fig_7.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.&mdash;Conjugate Foci of Curved Surfaces.</p></div>

<p><b>Concave Surfaces.</b>&mdash;Rays of light proceeding from any given
point in front of a concave spherical mirror, are reflected so as to meet
in another point, and the line joining the two points passes through
the centre of the sphere. The relation between them is or should be
mutual, hence they are termed <i>conjugate foci</i>. By a <i>focus</i> in general
is meant a point in which a number of rays of light meet, and the
rays which thus meet, taken collectively, are termed <i>a pencil</i>. <a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7</a>
represents two pencils of rays whose foci, S s, are conjugate, so that,
if either of them be regarded as an incident pencil, the other will be
the corresponding reflected pencil. Each point, in fact, sends a
pencil of rays which converge, after reflection, to the conjugate
focus. <i>The principal focal distance is half the radius of curvature.</i>
But it will not escape attention that concave mirrors have two
reflecting surfaces, a front and a back. This, however, does not
practically disturb its <i>virtual focus</i>, since the achromatic condenser
when brought into use collects and concentrates the light received
from the mirror upon an object for the purpose of rendering it more
distinctly visible to the eye when viewing an object placed on the
stage of the microscope. The images seen in a plane mirror are
always virtual, and any spherical mirror, whether concave or convex,
is nearly equivalent to a plane mirror when the distance of the
object from its surface is small in comparison with the radius of
curvature.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<h3>Lenses.</h3>

<p><b>Forms of Lenses.</b>&mdash;A lens is a portion of a refracting medium
bounded by two surfaces which are portions of spheres, having a
common axis, termed the <i>axis of the lens</i>. Lenses are distinguished
by different names, according to the nature of their surfaces.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_8" src="images/fig_8.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.&mdash;Converging and Diverging
Lenses.</p></div>

<p>Lenses with sharp edges
(thicker at the centre) are
<i>convergent</i> or <i>positive</i> lenses.
Lenses with blunt edges (thinner
at the centre) are <i>divergent</i> or
<i>negative</i> lenses. The first group
comprises:&mdash;(1) The bi-convex
lens; (2) the plano-convex lens;
(3) the convergent meniscus.
The second group:&mdash;(4) The concave lens; (5) the plano-concave
lens; (6) the divergent meniscus (<a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a>).</p>

<p><b>Principal Focus.</b>&mdash;A lens is usually a solid of revolution, and
the axis of revolution is termed the principal axis of the lens. When
the surfaces are spherical it is the line joining the centre of
curvature.</p>

<p>From the great importance of lenses, especially convex lenses, in
practical optics, it will be necessary to explain their properties somewhat
at length.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_9" src="images/fig_9.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.&mdash;Principal Focus of a Convex Lens.</p></div>

<p><b>Principal Focus of Convex Lens.</b>&mdash;When rays which were
originally parallel to the principal axis pass through a convex lens
(<a href="#fig_9">Fig. 9</a>), the effect of the two refractions which they undergo, one
on entering and the other on leaving the lens, is to make them all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
converge approximately to one point F, which is called the principal
focus. The distance A F of the principal focus from the lens is
called the principal focal distance, or more briefly and usually, the
focal length of the lens. The radiant point and its image after
refraction are known as the conjugate foci. In every lens the right
line perpendicular to the two surfaces is the <i>axis</i> of the lens. This
is indicated by the line drawn through the several lenses, as seen in
the diagram (<a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a>). The point where the axis cuts the surface of
the lens is termed the <i>verte</i>.</p>

<p>Parallel rays falling on a <i>double-convex</i> lens are brought to a focus
in the centre of its diameter; conversely, rays diverging from that
point are rendered parallel. Hence the focus of a <i>double-convex</i> lens
will be at just half the distance, or half the length, of the focus of
a <i>plano-convex</i> lens having the same curvature on one side. The
distance of the focus from the lens will depend as much on the
degree of curvature as upon the refracting power (termed the index
of refraction) of the glass of which it may be formed. A lens of
crown-glass will have a longer focus than a similar one of flint-glass;
since the latter has a greater refracting power than the former.
For all ordinary practical purposes we may consider the <i>principal
focus</i>&mdash;as the focus for parallel rays is termed&mdash;of a double-convex
lens to be at the distance of its radius, that is, in its centre of
curvature; and that of a plano-convex lens to be at the distance of
twice its radius, that is, at the other end of the diameter of its
sphere of curvature. The converse of all this occurs when divergent
rays are made to fall on a convex lens. Rays already converging
are brought together at a point nearer than the principal focus;
whereas rays diverging from a point within the principal focus are
rendered still more diverging, though in a diminished degree. Rays
diverging from points more distant than the principal focus on either
side, are brought to a focus beyond it: if the point of divergence
be within the circle of curvature, the focus of convergence will be
beyond it; and <i>vice-vers&acirc;</i>. The same principles apply equally to
a <i>plano-convex lens</i>; allowance being made for the double distance
of its principal focus; and also to a lens whose surfaces have
different curvatures; the principal focus of such a lens is found
by multiplying the radius of one surface by the radius of the
other, and dividing this product by half the sum of the radii.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_10" src="images/fig_10.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 10.&mdash;Principal Focus of Concave Lens.</p></div>

<p>In the case of a concave lens (<a href="#fig_10">Fig. 10</a>), rays incident parallel to
the principal axis diverge after passing through; and their directions,
if produced backwards, would approximately meet in a point F; this
is its <i>principal focus</i>. It is, however, only a virtual focus, inasmuch
as the emergent rays do not actually pass through it, whereas the
principal focus of a converging lens is real.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_11" src="images/fig_11.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 11.&mdash;Principal Centre of Lens.</p></div>

<p><b>Optical Centre of a Lens.</b>&mdash;<i>Secondary Axes.</i>&mdash;Let O and O′ (Fig.
11) be the centres of the two spherical surfaces of a lens. Draw any
two parallel radii, O I, O′ E, to meet these surfaces, and let the joining
line I E represent a ray passing
through the lens. This ray
makes equal angles with the
normals at I and E, since these
latter are parallel by construction;
hence the incident and
emergent rays S I, E R also
make equal angles with the
normals, and are therefore
parallel. In fact, if tangent
planes (indicated by the dotted
lines in the figure) are drawn
at I and E, the whole course
of the ray S I E R will be
the same as if it had passed through a plate bounded by these
planes.</p>

<p>Let C be the point in which the line I E cuts the principal axis,
and let R, R′ denote the radii of the two spherical surfaces. Then
from the similarity of the triangles O C I, O′ C E, we have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
(O C)/(C O′) = R′/R; which shows that the point C divides the line of centres
O O′ in a definite ratio depending only on the radii. Every ray
whose direction on emergence is parallel to its direction before
entering the lens, must pass through the point C in traversing the
lens; and conversely, every ray which in its course through the
lens traverses the point C, has parallel directions at incidence and
emergence. The point C which possesses this remarkable property
is called the <i>centre</i>, or <i>optical centre</i>, of the lens.</p>

<p>This diagram may also be taken to prove my former proposition,
that the convex lens is practically a form of two prisms
combined.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_12" src="images/fig_12.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 12.&mdash;Conjugate Foci, one Real, the other Virtual.</p></div>

<p><b>Conjugate Foci, one Real, one Virtual.</b>&mdash;When two foci are
on the same side of the lens, one (the most distant of the two) must
be virtual. For example, in <a href="#fig_12">Fig. 12</a>, if S, S′ are a pair of conjugate
foci, one of them S being between the principal focus F and the lens,
rays sent to the lens at a luminous point at S, will, after emergence,
diverge as if from S′; and rays coming from the other side of the
lens, if they converge to S′ before incidence, will in reality be made
to meet in S. As S moves towards the lens, S′ moves in the same
direction more rapidly; and they become coincident at the surface
of the lens.</p>

<p><b>Formation of Real Images.</b>&mdash;Let A B (<a href="#fig_13">Fig. 13</a>) be an object in
front of a lens, at a distance less than the principal focal length. It
will have a real image on the other side of the lens. To determine
the position of the image by construction, draw through any point A
of the object a line parallel to the principal axis, meeting the lens in
A′. The ray represented by this line will, after refraction, pass
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
through the principal focus, F, and its intersection with the secondary
axis, A O, determines the position of <i>a</i>, the focus conjugate to A.
We can in like manner determine the position of <i>b</i>, the focus
conjugate to B, another point of the object; and the joining
line <i>a b</i> will then be the magnified image of the line A B.
It is evident that if <i>a b</i> were the object, A B would be the
image.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_13" src="images/fig_13.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 13.&mdash;Real and Magnified Image.</p></div>

<p>The figures 12 and 13 represent the cases in which the distance
of the object is respectively greater and less than twice the focal
length of the lens.</p>

<p>The focal length of a lens is determined by the convexity of its
surfaces and the refractive power of the material of which it is
composed, being shortened either by an increase of refractive power,
or diminution of the radii of curvature of the faces of the lens. The
increase or decrease of spherical aberration is determined by the
shape or curvature of the lens; it is less in the bi-convex than in
other forms. When a lamp or other source of light is placed at the
focus of the rays constituting that portion of its light which falls
upon the lens, the light is so refracted as to become parallel.
Should the source of light be brought nearer to the lens than
the focus the refracted rays are still divergent, though not to the
same extent; on the other hand, if the source be beyond the
focus, the refracted rays are rendered convergent so as to meet
at a point which is mathematically related to the distance of
the luminous source from the focus. The former arrangement is
that with which we are most familiar, since it is the ordinary
magnifying glass.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<h3>Concave Lenses.</h3>

<p>The refracting influence of a <i>concave</i> lens (<a href="#fig_14">Fig. 14</a>) will be precisely
the opposite of that of a convex. Rays which fall upon it in
a parallel direction will be made to diverge as if from the principal
focus, which is here called the <i>negative</i> focus. This will be, for a
<i>plano-concave</i> lens, at the distance of the diameter of the sphere of
curvature; and for a <i>double-concave</i>, in the centre of that sphere.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_14" src="images/fig_14.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 14.&mdash;A Virtual Image formed by Concave Lens.</p></div>

<p>In <a href="#fig_14">Fig. 14</a> A B is the object and <i>a b</i> the image. Rays incident
from A and B parallel to the principal axis will emerge as if they
came from the principal focus F; hence, the points <i>a b</i> are determined
by the intersections of the dotted lines in the figure with the
secondary axis, O A, O B. An eye on the other side of the lens sees
the image <i>a b</i>, which is always virtual, erect and diminished.</p>

<p>In the construction of the microscope, either simple or compound,
the curvature of the lenses employed is usually spherical. Convergent
lenses, with spherical curvatures, have the defect of not bringing
all the rays of light which pass through them to one and the same
focus. Each circle of rays from the axis of the lens to its
circumference has a different focus, as shown in <a href="#fig_15">Fig. 15</a>. The rays
<i>a a</i>, which pass through the lens near its circumference, are seen to
be <i>more refracted</i>, or come to a focus at a shorter distance behind it
than the rays <i>b b</i>, which pass through near its centre or axis, and
are <i>less refracted</i>. The consequence of this defect of lenses with
spherical curvatures, which is called <i>spherical aberration</i>, is that a
well-defined image or picture is not formed by them, for when the
object is focussed, for the circumferential rays, the picture projected
to the eye is rendered indistinct by a halo or confusion produced by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
the central rays falling in a circle of dissipation, before they have
come to a focus. On the other hand, when placed in the focus of
the central rays, the picture formed by them is rendered indistinct
by the halo produced by the circumferential rays, which have already
come to a focus and crossed, and now fall in a state of divergence,
forming a circle of dissipation. The grosser defects of spherical
aberration are corrected by cutting off the passage of the rays <i>a a</i>,
through the circumferences of the lens, by means of a stop diaphragm,
so that the central rays, <i>b b</i>, only are concerned in the
formation of the image. This defect is reduced to a minimum, by
using the meniscus form of lens, which is the segment of an ellipsoid
instead of a sphere.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_15" src="images/fig_15.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 15.&mdash;Spherical Aberration of Lens.</p></div>

<p>The ellipse and the hyperbola are forms of lenses in which the
curvature diminishes from the central ray, or axis, to the circumference
<i>b</i>; and mathematicians have shown that spherical aberration
may be practically got rid of by employing lenses whose sections are
ellipses or hyperbolas. The remarkable discovery of these forms of
lenses is attributed to Descartes, who mathematically demonstrated
the fact.</p>

<p>If <i>a l</i>, <i>a l′</i>, for example (<a href="#fig_16">Fig. 16</a>) be part of an ellipse whose
greater axis is to the distance between its foci <i>f f</i> as the index of
refraction is to unity, then parallel rays <i>r l′</i>, <i>r′′ l</i> incident upon the
elliptical surface <i>l′ a l</i>, will be refracted by the single action of that
surface into lines which would meet exactly in the farther focus <i>f</i>,
if there were no second surface intervening between <i>l a l′</i> and <i>f</i>.
But as every useful lens must have two surfaces, we have only to
describe a circle <i>l a′ l′</i> round <i>f</i> as a centre, for the second surface of
the lens <i>l′ l</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_16" src="images/fig_16.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 16.&mdash;Converging Meniscus.</p></div>

<p>As all the rays refracted at the surface <i>l a l′</i> converge accurately
to <i>f</i>, and as the circular surface <i>l a′ l′</i> is perpendicular to every one
of the refracted rays, all these rays will go on to <i>f</i> without suffering
any refraction at the circular surface. Hence it should follow, that
a meniscus whose convex surface is part of an ellipsoid, and whose
concave surface is part of any spherical surface whose centre is in the
farther focus, will have no appreciable spherical aberration, and will
refract parallel rays incident on its convex surface to the farther focus.</p>

<p>The spherical form of lens is that most generally used in the
construction of the microscope. If a true elliptical or hyperbolic
curve could be ground, lenses would very nearly approach
perfection, and spherical aberration would be considerably
reduced. Even this defect can be further reduced in
practice by observing a certain ratio between the radii of
the anterior and posterior surfaces of lenses; thus the
spherical aberration of a lens, the radius of one surface
of which is six or seven times greater than that of the
other, will be much reduced when its more convex surface
is turned forward to receive parallel rays, than when
its less convex surface is turned forwards. It should be
borne in mind that in lenses having curvatures of the kind the
object would only be correctly seen in focus at one point&mdash;the
mathematical or geometrical axis of the lens.</p>

<p><b>Chromatic Aberration.</b>&mdash;We have yet to deal with one of the
most important of the phenomena of light, <small>CHROMATIC ABERRATION</small>,
upon the correction of which, in convex lenses in particular, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
perfection of the objective of the microscope so much depends.
Chromatism arises from the unequal refrangibility and length of the
different coloured rays of light that together go to make up white
light; but which, when treated of in optics, is always associated with
<i>achromatism</i>, so that a combination of prisms, or lenses, is said to be
<i>achromatic</i> when the coloured rays arising from the dispersion of the
pencil of light refracted through them are combined in due proportions
as they are in perfectly white light.</p>

<p>A lens, however, of uniform material will not form a single white
image, but a series of images of all colours of the spectrum, arranged
at different distances, the violet being nearest, and the red the most
remote, every other colour giving a blurred image; the superposition
of these and the blending of the different elementary rays furnishing
a complete explanation of the beautiful phenomenon of the rainbow.
Sharpness of outline is rendered quite impossible in such a case, and
this source of confusion is known as <i>chromatic aberration</i>.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain whether it is possible to remedy this evil by
combining lenses of two different materials, Newton made some trials
with a compound prism composed of glass and water (the latter containing
a little sugar of lead), and he found it impossible by any
arrangement of these two, or by other substances, to produce deviation
of the transmitted light without separation into its component
colours. If this ratio were the same for all substances, as Newton
supposed, achromatism would be impossible; but, in fact, its value
varies greatly, and is far greater for flint than for crown glass. If
two prisms of these substances, of small refracting angles, be combined
into one, with their edges turned in opposite directions, they
will achromatise each other.</p>

<p>The chromatism of lenses may, however, be somewhat further
reduced by stopping out the marginal rays, but as the most perfect
correction possible is required when lenses are combined for microscopic
uses, other means of correction are resorted to, as will be seen
hereafter. I shall first proceed to show the deviations which rays
of white light undergo in traversing a lens.</p>

<p>If parallel rays of light pass through a double-convex lens the
violet rays, the most refrangible of them, will come to a focus at a
point much nearer to the lens than the focus of the red rays, which
are the least refrangible; and the intermediate rays of the spectrum
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
will be focussed at points between the red and the violet. A screen
held at either of these foci will show an image with prismatic
fringes. The white light, A A′′ (<a href="#fig_18">Fig. 18</a>), falling on the marginal
portion of the lens is so far decomposed that the violet rays are brought
to a focus at C, and crossing there, diverge again and pass on to F F′,
while the red rays, B B′′, do not come to a focus until they reach
the point D, and cross the divergent violet rays, E E′. The foci
of the intermediary rays of the spectrum (red, green, and blue) are
intermediate between these extremes. The distance, C D, limiting
the blue or violet, and the red is termed the longitudinal chromatic
aberration of the lens. If the image be received upon a screen
placed at C, violet will predominate and appear surrounded by a
prismatic fringe, in which violet will predominate. If the screen be
now shifted to D, the image will have a predominant red tint,
surrounded by a series of coloured fringes in an inverted order to
those seen in the former experiment. The line E E′ joins the points
of intersection between the violet and red rays, and this marks the
mean focus, the point where the coloured rays will be least
apparent.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 18.&mdash;Chromatic Aberration of Lens.</p></div>

<p>In the early part of this century the optical correction of chromatic
aberration was partially brought about by combining a convex lens
of crown-glass with a concave lens of flint-glass, in the proportion of
which these two kinds of glass respectively refract and disperse rays
of light; so that the one medium may by equal and contrary dispersion
neutralise the dispersion caused by the other, without at the same
time wholly neutralising its refraction. It is a curious fact that the
media found most available for the purpose should be a combination
of crown and flint-glass, of <i>crown-glass</i> whose index of refraction is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
1·519, and dispersive power 0·036, and of <i>flint-glass</i> whose index of
refraction is 1·589, and dispersive power 0·0393. The focal length
of the convex crown-glass lens must be 4<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> inches, and that of the
concave flint-glass lens 7<sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> inches, and the combined focal length
10 inches. The diagram (<a href="#fig_19">Fig. 19</a>) shows how rays of light are
brought to a focus, nearly free from colour. The small amount
of residual colour in such a combination is termed the <i>secondary
spectrum</i>; the violet ray F Y, crossing the axis of the lens at V,
and going to the upper end P of the spectrum, the red ray F B
going to the lower end T. But as the flint-glass lens <i>l l</i>, on the
prism A <i>a</i> C, which receives the rays F V, F R, at the same points,
is interposed, these rays will unite at <i>f</i>, and form a small circle of
white light, the ray S F being now refracted without colour from
its primitive direction S F Y into the direction F <i>f</i>. In like manner,
the corresponding ray S F′ will be refracted to <i>f</i>, and a white
colourless image be the result.</p>

<p>The achromatic aplanatic objective constructed on the optical
formula enunciated, did not meet all the difficulties experienced by
the skilled microscopist, in obtaining resolution of the finest test
objects, and whereby the intrinsic value of the objective (in his
estimation) must stand or fall. There were other disturbing
residuary elements besides those of the secondary spectrum, and
which at a later period were met by the practical skill of the
optician, who applied the screw-collar, and by means of which the
back lens of the objective is made to approach the front lens, thus
more accurately shortening the distance between the eye-piece, where
the image is eventually formed, and the back lens of the objective.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p>In this diagram L L is a <i>convex</i> lens of <i>crown-glass</i>, and <i>l l</i> a
<i>concave</i> one of <i>flint-glass</i>. A convex lens will refract a ray of
light (S) falling at F on it exactly in the same manner as the prism
A B C, whose faces touch the two surfaces of the lens at the points
where the ray enters, and quits. The ray S F, thus refracted by the
lens L L, or prism A B C, would have formed a spectrum (P T) on
a screen or wall, had there been no other lens.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_20" src="images/fig_20.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 20.&mdash;Virtual Image formed by Convex Lens.</p></div>

<p><b>Formation of Virtual Images.</b>&mdash;The normal eye possesses a
considerable power of adjusting itself to form a distinct image of
objects placed at varying distances; the nearer, within a certain
limit, the larger it appears, and the more distinctly the details
are brought out. When brought within a distance of two or three
inches, the images become blurred or quite indistinct, and when
brought closer to the eye, cannot be seen at all, and it simply
obstructs the light. Now the utility of a convex lens, when interposed
between the object and the eye, consists in reducing the
divergence of the rays forming the several pencils which issue from
it, and send images to the retina in a state of moderate divergence,
that is, as if they had issued from an object beyond the nearest
point of distinct vision, and so that a more clearly defined image
may reach the sensitive membrane of the eye. But, not only is
the course of the several rays in each pencil altered as regards the
rest, but the course of the pencils themselves is changed, so that
they enter the eye under an angle corresponding with that under
which they would have arrived from a larger object situated at
a greater distance, and thus the picture formed by any object
corresponds in all respects with one which would have been made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
by the same object increased in its dimensions and viewed at the
smallest ordinary distance of distinct vision. For instance, let an
object A B (<a href="#fig_20">Fig. 20</a>) be placed between a convex lens and its
principal focus. Then the foci conjugate to the points A B are
virtual, and their positions can be found by construction from the
consideration that rays through A, B, parallel to the principal axis,
will be refracted to F, the principal focus on the other side. The
refracted rays, if produced backwards, must meet the secondary axis
O A, O B in the required points. An eye placed on the other side
of the lens will accordingly see a virtual image erect, magnified, and
at a greater distance from the lens than the object. This is the
principle of the simple microscope.</p>

<h3>The Human Eye.</h3>

<p>To gain a clear insight into the mode in which a single lens serves
to magnify objects, it will be necessary to revert to the phenomena
of ordinary vision. An eye free from any defect has a considerable
power of adjusting itself to very considerable distances. One of the
special functions of the eye is bringing the rays of light, by a series
of dioptric mechanisms, to a perfect focus on its nervous sensitive
layer, the retina. The eye in this respect has been compared to a
photographic camera. But this is not quite correct. The retina is
destined simply to receive the images furnished by the dioptric
apparatus, and has no influence upon the formation of these images.
The luminous rays are refracted by the dioptric apparatus; the
images would be formed quite as well&mdash;indeed, even better in certain
cases&mdash;if the retina were not there. The dioptric apparatus and its
action are absolutely independent of the retina.</p>

<p>The same laws with regard to the passage of the rays of light into
the human eye hold good, as those already enunciated in the
previous pages. As to change of direction when rays are passing
obliquely from a medium of low density to that of a higher density,
<i>i.e.</i>, it changes its course, and is bent towards the perpendicular. On
leaving the denser for the rarer medium it is bent once more from
the perpendicular. Again, by means of a convex lens, the rays of
light from one source will be refracted so as to meet at a point
termed <i>the principal focus</i> of vision.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>In the eye there are several surfaces separating the different
media where refraction takes place. The refractive index of the
aqueous humour and the tears poured out by the lachrymal gland
is almost equal to that of the cornea. We may, therefore,
speak of the refracting surfaces as three, viz.: Anterior surface
of cornea, anterior surface of lens, and posterior surface of
lens; and also of the refracting media as three&mdash;the aqueous
humour, the lens, and vitreous humour. These several bodies
are so adapted in the normal eye that parallel rays falling on
the cornea are converged to a focus at the most sensitive spot
(the <i>yellow spot</i>, or <i>fovea centralis</i>) in the retina, a point representing
to the principal focus of the eye. A line drawn from this
point through the centre of the cornea is called the optic axis of the
eye-ball.</p>

<p>But as we are able to form a distinct image of near objects, and
as we notice when we turn our gaze from far to near objects there
is a distinct feeling of muscular effort in the eyes, there must be
some means whereby the eye can readily adapt itself for focussing
near and distant objects. In a photographic camera the focus can
be readily altered, either by changing the lenses, employing a lens of
greater or less curvature, or by altering the distance of the screen
from the lens. The last method is obviously impossible in the rigid
eye-ball, and therefore the act of focussing for near and distant
objects is associated with a change in the curvature of the lens, a
faculty of the eye termed <i>accommodation</i> (<a href="#fig_22">Fig. 22</a>), a change chiefly
accomplished by the ciliary (muscle) processes, which pull the lens
forwards and inwards by virtual contracting power of the ciliary
muscle, and by which its suspensory ligament is relaxed, and the
front of the lens allowed to bulge forward. In every case, however,
accommodation is associated with contraction of the iris, the special
function of which is that of a limiting diaphragm (an iris-diaphragm),
<a href="#fig_23">Fig. 23</a>.</p>

<p>In an ordinary spherical bi-convex lens, as already pointed out, the
rays of light passing through the periphery of the lens come to a
focus at a nearer point than the rays passing through the central
portion. In this way a certain amount of blurring of the image
takes place, and which, in optical language, is termed <i>spherical
aberration</i>. This defect of the eye is capable of correction in three
possible ways, and which it may be well to repeat: 1. By making
the refractive index of the lens higher at its centre than at its
circumference; (2) By making the curvature of the lens less near the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
circumference than at the centre; (3) By stopping out the peripheral
rays of light by a diaphragm. The two latter methods are those
resorted to in most optical instruments.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_23" src="images/fig_23.jpg" alt="" />

<p>3. Fibres or Tubules of Lens, &times; 250, seen to be made up of superimposed
crenated layers, and is therefore not homogeneous in structure, but made up of a
number of extremely fine tubules, whose curvatures are nearly spherical.</p></div>

<p>In the human eye an attempt is made to apply all these methods,
but the most important is the third, that of applying the diaphragm
formed by the iris, a circular semi-muscular curtain lying just in
front of the anterior surface of the lens. The iris is also furnished
with a layer of pigmental cells which effectually stop out all
peripheral rays of light that otherwise would pass into the eye,
creating circles of diffusion of a disturbing nature to perfect
vision. This delicate membrane, then, is kept in constant action by
a two-fold nerve supply, derived from five or six sources, which it is
unnecessary to describe at length. But the eye, with all its marvellous
adaptations, has an obvious defect, that of secondary or
uncorrected chromatic aberration.</p>

<p><b>Chromatic Aberration of the Eye.</b>&mdash;White light, as previously
explained, is composed of different wave lengths; and accordingly as
these undulations are either longer or shorter, so do they produce
on the eye the impression of different colours. We have seen how
a pencil of white light may, by means of a prism, be decomposed into
a multi-coloured band. In an ordinary magnifying reading-glass
these coloured fringes are always seen around the margins. In
practical optics chromatic aberration is partially corrected by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
employing two different kinds of glass in the construction of certain
combined lenses. In the human eye chromatism cannot be
corrected in this way; hence a blue light and a red light placed
at the same distance from the eye appears to be unequally distant:
the red light requiring greater accommodation in the eye
than the blue, and this accordingly appears to be the nearer of
the two.</p>

<p>This visual error may be experimentally shown and explained.
There is a kind of glass which at first sight appears dark blue or
violet, but which really contains a great deal of red. Take an
ordinary microscope lamp, having a metal or opaque chimney, and
drill a circular hole in it, about 3 mm. in diameter. This opening
should be just at the height of the flame; cover it over with
a piece of ground glass and a piece of the red-blue glass.
Thus will be formed a luminous point whose light is composed
of red and blue, <i>i.e.</i>, of colours far apart from each other in the
spectrum.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_24" src="images/fig_24.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 24.&mdash;Chromatic Aberration of Eye, showing the wave differences of the
<i>blue and red rays of light</i> (<i>Landolt</i>).</p></div>

<p>If rays coming from this point enter the eye, the blue rays (<a href="#fig_24">Fig. 24</a>),
being more strongly reflected than the red, will come to a focus sooner
than the latter. The red rays, on the contrary, will be brought to a
focus later than the blue, while the latter, past their focus, are
diverging. Let A B C D (<a href="#fig_24">Fig. 24</a>) be the section of a pencil of rays
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
given off from a red-blue point sufficiently distant so that these rays
may be regarded as parallel. The focus of the blue is at <i>b</i>, that of
the red at <i>r</i>.</p>

<p>An eye is adapted to the distance of the luminous point when the
circle of diffusion, received upon the retina, is at its minimum. This
is the case when the sentient layer of the retina lies between the
two foci E. In this case the point will appear as a small circle,
composed of the two colours, that is to say&mdash;violet. If the retina
be <i>in front</i> of this point, at the focus of the <i>blue</i> rays for instance,
the eye will perceive a <i>blue point surrounded by a red circle</i>, the
latter being formed by the periphery of the luminous cone of red
rays, which are focussed only after having passed the retina. The
blue point will become a circle of diffusion larger in proportion as
the retina is nearer the dioptric system, or as the focus for blue is
farther behind it. But the blue circle will always be surrounded by
a red ring. If, on the contrary, the retina is <i>behind the focus for
red</i>, the blue cone will be greater in diameter than the red, and we
shall have a <i>red circle of diffusion</i>, larger in proportion as the retina
is farther from the focus, but always <i>surrounded by a blue ring</i> M. If
the blue-red point is five metres, or more, distant, the <i>emmetropic</i><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> eye
will evidently see it more distinctly, <i>i.e.</i>, as a small <i>violet point</i>; the
<i>hyperopic</i> eye, whose retina is situated <i>in front</i> of the focus of its
dioptric system, will see a <i>blue circle, surrounded by red</i>; the <i>myopic</i>
eye, whose retina is <i>behind</i> its focus, will see a <i>red circle, surrounded
by blue</i>. The size of these circles will be either larger or smaller
when the principal focus of the eye is either in <i>front</i> of or <i>behind
the retina</i>.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>The refractive surfaces of a perfectly formed eye are very like an
ellipsoid of revolution with two axes, one of which, the major axis of
the ellipse, is at the same time the optic axis and that of rotation;
the other is perpendicular to it, and is equal in all meridians. Eyes,
however, perfectly constructed are rarely met with. The curvature
of the cornea is nearly always greater in one meridian than in
another. Its surfaces then cannot be regarded as entirely belonging
to an ellipsoid of revolution, since the solid figure, of which the former
would constitute a part, has not only two axes, but three, and these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
unequal. This irregularity is not, however, always great enough to
produce discomfort and it is therefore disregarded. But in other cases
the difference of curvature in the different meridians of the eye attain
to a higher degree, and vision falls far below the average.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_25" src="images/fig_25.jpg" alt="" />
<p>Fig. 25.&mdash;Lines as seen by the
Astigmatic.</p></div>

<p>The refractive anomaly alluded to is termed <i>astigmatism</i> (from
the Greek, α privative, στιγμα, a point&mdash;inability to see a point).
The way in which objects appear to such a person will mainly result
from the way in which he sees <i>a point</i>. Take, for example, the
vertical to be the most, and the horizontal to be the least, refractive
meridian: place a vertical line (<a href="#fig_25">Fig. 25</a>, I) at a stated distance before
the eye, and the line will appear elongated, owing to the diffusion
image of each of the points composing
it. It will also seem to be somewhat
broadened, as at II. If the <i>vertical</i>
meridian is adapted to the distance of
the vertical, the line will appear very
diffuse and broadened, as at III. All
these little diffusion lines overlap each
other, and give the line an elongated
appearance. Hence a straight line is
seen distinctly by an astigmatic eye
only when the meridian to which it is
perpendicular is perfectly adapted to
its distance. A <i>vertical line</i> is seen
distinctly when the <i>horizontal meridian</i> is adapted to its distance.
It appears <i>indistinct</i> when its image is formed by the vertical meridian.
The way in which an astigmatic person sees points and lines led to
the discovery of this remarkable irregularity in the refraction of the
eye. The late Astronomer Royal, Sir George Airy, suffered for some
years until, indeed, he discovered how it could be corrected. This
anomaly of curvature of the refractive surfaces of the eye is now
known to prevail largely among the more civilised races of mankind.
It is, then, of very great importance when using high powers of the
microscope. In most persons the visual power of both eyes is
rarely quite equal; on the other hand, the mind exerts an important
influence, dominates, as it were, the eye in the interpretation of
visual sensations and images. An example of this is presented in
Wheatstone’s pseudoscope, known to produce precisely the opposite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
effect of his stereoscope&mdash;conveys, in fact, the <i>converse of relief</i>
produced by the latter and better known instrument.</p>

<p><b>Visual Judgment.</b>&mdash;The apparent size of an object is determined
by the magnitude of the image formed on the retina, and this is
inversely proportional to the distance. Thus the size of an image
on the retina of an object two inches long at a distance of a foot, is
equal to the image of an object four inches long at a distance of two
feet. An object can be seen if the visual angle subtended by it is
not less than sixty seconds. This is equivalent to an image on the
<i>fovea centralis</i> of the retina of about 4 &micro;<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> across, and which corresponds
to the diameter of a cone: so that while we have had under
consideration the optical and physical conditions of human vision, we
have likewise taken a lesson on the action of lenses used in the
construction of the microscope.</p>

<h3>The Theory of Microscopical Vision.</h3>

<p>It has been said that no comparison can be instituted between
microscopic vision and macroscopic; that the images formed by
minute objects are not delineated microscopically under ordinary
laws of diffraction, and that the results are dioptrical. This assertion,
however, cannot be accepted unconditionally, as will be seen
on more careful examination of the late Professor Abbe’s masterly
exposition of “The Microscopical Theory of Vision,” and also his subsequent
investigations on the estimation of aperture and the value
of wide-angled immersion objectives, published in the “Journal of
the Royal Microscopical Society.”</p>

<p>The essential point in Abbe’s theory of microscopical vision is that
the images of minute objects in the microscope are not formed exclusively
on the ordinary <i>dioptric</i> method (that is, in the same way in
which they are formed in the camera or telescope), but that they are
largely affected by the peculiar manner in which the minute construction
of the object breaks up the incident rays, giving rise to
<i>diffraction</i>.</p>

<p>The phenomena of diffraction in general may be observed experimentally
by plates of glass ruled with fine lines. <a href="#fig_26">Fig. 26</a> shows the
appearance presented by a single candle-flame seen through such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
a plate, an uncoloured image of the flame occupying the centre,
flanked on either side by a row of coloured spectra of the flame,
which become dimmer as they recede from the centre. A similar
phenomenon may be produced by dust scattered over a glass plate,
and by other objects whose structure contains very minute particles,
or the meshes of very fine gauze wire, the rays suffering a
characteristic change in passing through such objects; that change
consisting in the breaking up of a parallel beam of light into a group
of rays, diverging with wide angle and forming a regular series of
maxima and minima of intensity of light, due to difference of phase
of vibration.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_26" src="images/fig_26.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 26.</p></div>

<p>In the same way, in the microscope, the diffraction pencil originating
from a beam incident upon, for instance, a diatom, appears
as a fan of isolated rays, decreasing
in intensity as they are further
removed from the direction of the
incident beam transmitted through
the structure, the interference of the
primary waves giving a number of successive maxima of light with
dark interspaces.</p>

<p>When a diaphragm opening is interposed between the mirror, and
a plate of ruled lines placed upon the stage such as <a href="#fig_27">Fig. 27</a>, the
appearance shown in <a href="#fig_27">Fig. 27</a><i>a</i>, will be observed at the back of the
objective on removing the eye-piece and looking down the tube of
the microscope. The centre circles are the images of the diaphragm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
opening produced by the direct rays, while those on the other side
(always at right angles to the direction of the lines) are the diffraction
images produced by the rays which are bent off from the incident
pencil. In homogeneous light the central and lateral images agree
in size and form, but in white light the diffraction images are radially
drawn out, with the outer edges red and the inner blue (the reverse
of the ordinary spectrum), forming, in fact, regular spectra the
distance separating each of which varies inversely as the closeness
of the lines, being for instance with the same objective twice as far
apart when the lines are twice as close.</p>

<div class="table w100">

<img id="fig_27a" src="images/fig_27a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 27<i>a</i>.</p></div></div>

<p>The influence of these diffraction spectra may be demonstrated
by some very striking experiments, which show that they are not by
any means accidental phenomena, but are directly connected with
the image which is seen by the eye.</p>

<p>The first experiment shows that with the central beam, or any one
of the spectral beams alone, only the contour of the object is seen,
the addition of at least one diffraction spectrum being essential to
the visibility of the structure.</p>

<p>When by a diaphragm placed at the back of the objective, as in
<a href="#fig_28">Fig. 28</a>, we cover up all the diffraction spectra of <a href="#fig_27">Fig. 27</a><i>a</i>, and allow
only the central rays to reach the image, the object will appear to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
wholly deprived of fine details, the outline alone will remain, and
every delineation of minute structure will disappear, just as if the
microscope had suddenly lost its optical power, as in <a href="#fig_28">Fig. 28</a><i>a</i>.</p>

<p>This experiment illustrates a case of the <i>obliteration</i> of structure
by obstructing the passage of the diffraction spectra to the eye-piece.
The next experiment shows how the appearance of fine structure may
be <i>created</i> by manipulating the spectra.</p>

row of spectra in <a href="#fig_27">Fig. 27</a><i>a</i>, that row will obviously become identical
with the lower one, and if the theory holds good, we should find the
image of the upper lines identical with that of the lower. On
replacing the eye-piece, we see that it is so, the upper set of
lines are doubled in number, a new line appearing in the centre
of the space between each of the old (upper) ones, and upper and
lower set having become to all appearance identical, as seen in
<a href="#fig_29">Fig. 29</a><i>a</i>.</p>

<p>A case of apparent creation of structure, similar in principle to the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
as in <a href="#fig_31">Fig. 31</a>, having sides <i>parallel</i> to this page, which gives the spectra
shown in <a href="#fig_31">Fig. 31</a><i>a</i>, consisting of vertical rows for the horizontal lines
and horizontal rows for the vertical ones. But it is readily seen that
two diagonal rows of spectra exist at right angles to the diagonals of the
squares, just as would arise from sets of lines in the direction of the
diagonals, so that if the theory holds good we ought to find, on obstructing
all the other spectra and allowing only the diagonal ones to pass
to the eye-piece, that the vertical and horizontal lines have disappeared
and are replaced by two new sets of lines at <i>right angles to the
diagonals</i>.</p>

<p>An object such as <i>Pleurosigma angulatum</i>, which gives six diffraction
spectra arranged as in <a href="#fig_33">Fig. 33</a>, should, according to this theory,
show markings in a hexagonal arrangement. For there will be one

<i>c</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>f</i>, and a third at right angles to <i>g</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>d</i>. These three sets of

<p>A great variety of appearances may be produced with the same
arrangement of spectra. Any two adjacent spectra with the central
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
beam (as <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>a</i>) will form equilateral triangles and give hexagonal
markings. Or by stopping off all but <i>g</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>e</i> (or <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>f</i>), we again
have the spectra in the form of equilateral triangles; but as they are
now further apart, the sides of the triangles in the two cases being
as √3 : 1, the hexagons will be smaller and three times as
numerous. Their sides will also be arranged at a different angle to
those of the first set. The hexagons may be entirely obliterated by
admitting only the spectra <i>g</i>, <i>c</i>, or <i>g</i>, <i>f</i>, or <i>b</i>, <i>f</i>, etc., when new lines
will appear at right angles, or obliquely inclined, to the median line.
By varying the combinations of the spectra, therefore, different
figures of varying size and positions are produced, all of which
cannot, of course, represent the true structure.
Not only, however, may the appearance
of particular structure be obliterated
or created, but it may even be <i>predicted</i>
before being seen under the microscope. If
the position and relative intensity of the
spectra in any particular case are given, the
character of the resultant image, in some
instances, may be worked out by mathematical
calculations. A remarkable instance
of such a prediction is to be found in the case recorded by Mr.
Stephenson, where a mathematical student who had never seen
a diatom, worked out the purely mathematical result of the interference
of the six spectra <i>b-g</i> of <a href="#fig_33">Fig. 33</a> (identical with <i>P. angulatum</i>),
giving the drawing copied in <a href="#fig_34">Fig. 34</a>. The special feature was the
small markings between the hexagons, which had not, before this
time, been noticed on <i>P. angulatum</i>. On more closely scrutinizing
a valve, stopping out the central beam and allowing the six spectra
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
only to pass, the small markings were found actually to exist, though
they were so faint they had previously escaped observation until the
result of the mathematical deduction had shown that they <i>ought</i> to
be seen.</p>

<p>These experiments seem to show that diffraction plays a very essential
part in the formation of microscopical images, since dissimilar
structures give identical images when the differences of their
diffractive effect is removed, and conversely similar structures
may give dissimilar images when their diffractive images are made
dissimilar. Whilst a purely dioptric image answers point for point
to the object on the stage, and enables a safe inference to be drawn
as to the actual nature of that object, the visible indications
of minute structure in a microscopical image are not always or
necessarily conformable to the real nature of the object examined,
so that nothing more can safely be inferred from the image as presented
to the eye, than the presence in the object of such structural
peculiarities as will produce the particular diffraction phenomena on
which these images depend.</p>

<p>Further investigations and experiments led Abbe to discard so
much of his theoretical conclusions relating to superimposed images
having a distinct character as well as a different origin, and as to
their capability of being separated and examined apart from each
other. In a later paper he writes: “I no longer maintain in principle
the distinction between the absorption image or direct dioptrical
image and the diffraction image, nor do I hold that the microscopical
image of an object consists of two superimposed images of different
origin or a different mode of production. Thus it appears that both
the absorption image and the diffraction image he held to be equally
of diffraction origin; but while a lens of small aperture would give
the former with facility, it would be powerless to reveal the latter,
because of its limited capacity to gather in the strongly-deflected
rays due to the excessively minute bodies the microscopical objective
has to deal with.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>Abbe’s theory of vision has been questioned by mathematicians,
and since his death Lord Rayleigh went more deeply into the
question of “the theory of the formation of optical images,” with
special reference to the microscope and telescope. He has shown
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
that two lines cannot be fairly resolved unless their components
subtend an angle exceeding that subtended by the wave-length of
light at a distance equal to the aperture; also, that the measure of
resolution is only possible with a square aperture, or one bounded
by straight lines, parallel to the lines resolved.</p>

<h3>Lord Rayleigh’s Theory of the Formation of Optical Images,
with Special Reference to the Microscope.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></h3>

<p>Of the two methods adopted, that of Helmholtz’s consists in
tracing the image representative of a mathematical point in the
object, the point being regarded as self-luminous; that of Abbe’s the
typical object was not, as we have seen, a luminous <i>point</i>, but a <i>grating</i>
illuminated by plane waves of light. In the latter method, Lord
Rayleigh argues that the complete representation of the object
requires the co-operation of all the spectra which are focussed in the
principal focal plane of the objective; when only a few are present
the representation is imperfect, and wholly fails when there is only
one. He then proceeds to show, by the aid of diagrams and mathematical
formula, how the resolving power can be adduced.</p>

<p>On further criticism of the Abbe spectrum theory, he observes
“that although the image ultimately formed may be considered to be
due to the spectra focussed to a given point, the degree of conformity
of the image to the object is another question. The consideration
of the case of a very fine grating, which might afford no lateral
spectra at all, shows the incorrectness of the usually accepted idea
that if all the spectra are utilised the image will still be incomplete,
so that the theory (originally promulgated by Abbe) requires a good
deal of supplementing; while it is inapplicable when the incident
light is not parallel, and when the object is, for example, a double
point and not a grating. Even in the case of a grating, the spectrum
theory is inapplicable, if the grating is self-luminous; for in this
case no spectra can be formed since the radiations from the different
elements of the grating have no permanent phase-relations.” For
these reasons Lord Rayleigh advises that the question should be reconsidered
from the older point of view, according to which the typical
object is a point and not a grating. Such treatment will show that the
theory of resolving power is essentially the same for all instruments.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
The peculiarities of the microscope, arising from the divergence-angles
not being limited to be small, and from the different character
of the illumination, are theoretically only differences of detail.
These investigations can be extended to gratings, and the results so
obtained confirm for the most part the conclusions of the spectrum
theory.</p>

<p>Furthermore, that the function of the condenser in microscopic
practice in throwing upon the object the image of the lamp-flame is
to cause the object to behave, at any rate in some degree, as if it were
self-luminous, and thus to obviate the sharply-marked interference
bands which arise when permanent and definite phase-relations are
permitted to exist between the radiations which issue from various
points of the object. This is capable of mathematical proof; and in
the case where the illumination is such that each point of the row or of
the grating radiates independently, the limit to resolution is seen
to depend only on the width of the aperture, and thus to be the same
for all forms of aperture as for those of the rectangular. That Abbe’s
theory of microscopic vision is fairly open to the criticisms passed on
it by Lord Rayleigh must be taken for granted.</p>

<h3>Definition of Aperture; Principles of Microscopic Vision.</h3>

<p>It must be well within the last half-century that the achromatic
objective-glass for the microscope was brought to perfection and its
value became generally recognised. Prior to the discovery of the
achromatic principle in the construction of lenses it was assumed
that the formation of the microscopic image took place (as we have
already seen) on ordinary dioptric principles. As the image is formed
in the camera or telescope, so it was said to be in the microscope.
This belief existed, it will be remembered, at a time when dry
objectives only were in favour and the use of the term <i>angle of
aperture</i> was misunderstood, when it was supposed that the different
media with diffraction-indices were used; and the angle of the
radiant pencil was believed not only to admit of a comparison of two
apertures in the same medium, but likewise to admit of a standard of
comparison when the media were entirely different in their refractive
qualities.</p>

<p>It was during my tenure of office as secretary of the Royal Microscopical
Society (1867 to 1873), that the aperture question, and also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
that of <i>numerical aperture</i>, came under discussion, both being met
by the majority of the Fellows of the Society and practical opticians
by a <i>non-possumus</i>.</p>

<p>Opticians alleged, that is, before the value of aperture became fully
recognised (1860), that the achromatic objective had reached a stage
of perfection, beyond which it was not possible to go; indeed, not
only opticians, but physicists of high standing, as Professor Helmholtz,
who made many important contributions to the theory of the microscope,
and who, after duly weighing all the known physical laws on
which the formation of images can be explained, emphatically stated
that in his opinion “the limit of possible improvement of the
microscope as an instrument of discovery had been very nearly
reached.” A quarter of a century ago I ventured to throw a doubt
upon so questionable a statement. I determined, if possible, to
submit the aperture question to an exhaustive examination. My
views were accordingly submitted to two of the highest authorities
in this country&mdash;Sir George Airy, the then Astronomer Royal, and
Sir George Stokes, Professor of Physics at Cambridge University&mdash;both
of whom agreed with me that the possible increase of aperture
would be attended with great advantage to the objective, and open
the way to an extension of power resolution in the microscope.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
The discussion afterwards took a warm turn, as will be seen on
reference to “The Monthly Microscopical Journals” of 1874,
1875 and 1876.</p>

<p>The confusion into which the aperture question at this period
had lapsed was no doubt due to the fact that its opponents had not
yet grasped the true meaning of the term <i>aperture</i>. It was believed
to be synonymous with “angular aperture,” much in use at the time.
It will, however, appear quite unaccountable that even the older
opticians should have confounded the latter with the former; and so
entirely disregarded the fact that the angles of the pencil of light
admitted by the objective cannot serve as a measure of its <i>aperture</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
and that high refractive media can greatly reduce the value length
of waves of light.</p>

<p>When the medium in which the objective works is the same as
air, it is not that a comparison can be made by the angles of the
radiant pencils only, but by their sines. For example, if two dry
objectives admit pencils of 60&deg; and 180&deg;, their real apertures are not
as 1 : 3, but as 1 : 2 only. Aperture in fact is computed by mathematicians
by tracing the rays from the back focus through the system
of lenses to the front focus, the front focus being the point at which
the whole cone of rays converge as free as may be from aberration.
If the front focus be in air, no pencil greater than 82&deg;, “double
the angle of total reflection,” can <i>emerge</i> from the plane front of the
lens; and, obviously, if no greater cone can emerge to a focus one way,
neither can any greater cone enter the body of the lens from the
radiant. This angle, then, of 82&deg;, must be regarded as the limit for
dry lenses or objectives.</p>

<p>This limit, it will be seen on more careful examination, is very
nearly the maximum angle that can be computed for a lens to have
a front focus in air. This can be proved by the consideration
of the angle of the image of rays, as they are radiated from the
object itself in balsam: for although this angle of image rays viewed
as nascent from a self-luminous object capable of scattering rays in
all directions, may be 180&deg; in the substance of the balsam
and cover-glass, of the 180&deg; only 82&deg; of the central portion
will emerge into air&mdash;all rays beyond this limit are internally
reflected at the cover-glass. This cone, then, of 82&deg; becomes
180&deg; in air, and a large part must necessarily be lost by
reflection at the first incidence on the plane front of the lens. But
with a formula permitting the use of a water medium between the
front lens and the cover-glass, the aperture of the image rays may
reach 126&deg;&mdash;double the critical angle from glass to water; and with
an oil medium, the aperture will be found to be limited only by the
form of the front lens that can be constructed by the optician.</p>

<p>To sum up, then, the effect of the immersion system, greatly
assists in the correction of aberration, gives increased magnification
and angular aperture, increase of working distance between the
objective and object, and renders admissible the use of the thicker
glass-cover.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>The aperture question would in all probability have remained
unsolved many years longer (ten or twelve years elapsed after I
brought the question under discussion before opticians gave way),
but for the fortunate circumstance that the eminent mathematical
and practical optician, Professor Abbe, of Jena, was about to visit
London. This came off in the early part of the seventies, when the
late Mr. John Mayall and myself had the good fortune to interview
him. The subject discussed was naturally the increase of aperture
and the theory of microscopical vision. He readily at our request
undertook to re-investigate the question in all its bearings on the
microscope. It is almost unnecessary to add that the conclusions he
came to, and the results obtained, have proved of inestimable value to
the microscopist and practical optician, and it may well seem necessary
to explain somewhat at greater length the conclusions the learned
Professor came to, and by the adoption of which the microscope has
been placed on a more scientific basis than it had before attained
to. Several papers were published <i>in extenso</i> in the “Journal
of the Royal Microscopical Society,” and I am greatly indebted
to Mr. Frank Crisp, LL.D., for an excellent <i>resum&eacute;</i> of Abbe’s
Monograph.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>The essential step in the consideration of aperture is, as I have
said, to understand clearly what is meant by the term. It will at
once be recognised that its definition must necessarily refer to its
primary meaning of <i>opening</i>, and must, in the case of an optical
instrument, define its capacity for receiving rays from the object,
and transmitting them to the image received at the eye-piece.</p>

<p>In the case of the telescope-objective, its capacity for receiving
and transmitting rays is necessarily measured by the expression of its
absolute diameter or “opening.” No such absolute measure can be
applied in the case of the microscope objective, the largest constructed
lenses of which having by no means the largest apertures, being, in
fact, the lower powers of the instrument, whose apertures are for
the most part but small. The capacity of a microscope objective
for receiving and transmitting rays is, however, as will be seen,
estimated by its <i>relative</i> opening, that is, its opening in relation to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
its focal length. When this relative opening has been ascertained,
it may be regarded as synonymous with that denoted in the telescope
by <i>absolute</i> opening. That this is so will be better appreciated by
the following consideration:&mdash;</p>

<p>In a single lens, the rays admitted within one meridional plane
evidently increase as the diameter of the lens (all other circumstances
remaining the same), and in the microscope we have, at the back of
the lens, the same conditions to deal with as are in front in the case
of the telescope; the larger or smaller number of emergent rays will
therefore be measured by the clear diameter, and as no rays can
emerge that have not first been admitted, this will give the measure
of the admitted rays under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>If the lenses compared have different focal lengths but the same
clear “openings,” they will transmit the same number of rays to
equal areas of an image at a definite distance, because they would
admit the same number if an object were substituted for the image;
that is, if the lens were used as a telescope-objective. But as the
focal lengths are different, the amplification of the images is different
also, and equal areas of these images correspond to different areas of
the object from which the rays are collected. Therefore, the higher
power lens with the same opening as the lower power, will admit a
<i>greater</i> number of rays in all from the same object, because it admits
the <i>same</i> number as the latter from a <i>smaller</i> portion of the object.
Thus, if the focal lengths of two lenses are as 2 : 1, and the first
amplifies <small>N</small> diameters, the second will amplify 2 <small>N</small> with the same
distance of the image, so that the rays which are collected <i>to</i> a given
field of 1 mm. diameter of the image are admitted <i>from</i> a field of
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>N</sub> mm. in the first case, and of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2N</sub> mm. in the second. As the
“opening” of the objective is estimated by the diameter (and not
by the area) the higher power lens admits <i>twice</i> as many rays as the
lower power, because it admits the same number from a field of half
the diameter, and, in general, the admission of rays by the same
opening, but different powers, must be in the inverse ratio of the
focal lengths.</p>

<p>In the case of the single lens, therefore, its aperture is determined
by the ratio between the clear opening and the focal length. The
same considerations apply to the case of a compound objective,
substituting, however, for the clear opening of the single lens the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
diameter of the pencil at its emergence from the objective, that is,
the clear utilised diameter of the back lens. All equally holds good
whether the medium in which the objective is placed is the same in
the case of the two objectives or different, as an alteration of the
medium makes no difference
in the power.</p>

back lenses of various dry and immersion
objectives of the same power (&frac14;-in.) from an
air angle of 60&deg; to an oil angle of 180&deg;.</p></div>

<p>Thus we arrive at a
general proposition for all
kinds of objectives: 1st,
when the power is the same,
the admission of rays (or
aperture) varies with the
diameter of the pencil at
its emergence; 2nd, when
the powers are different,
the same aperture requires
different openings in the
ratio of the focal lengths,
or conversely with the same
opening the aperture is in
inverse ratio to the focal
lengths. We see, therefore,
that just as in the
telescope the absolute diameter
of the object-glass
defines its <i>aperture</i>, so in
the microscope <i>the ratio
between the utilised diameter
of the back lens and the
focal length</i> of the objective defines its aperture also, and this is
clearly a definition of aperture in its primary and only legitimate
meaning as “opening;” that is, the capacity of the objective
for admitting rays from the object and transmitting them to the
image.</p>

<p>If, by way of illustration, we compare a series of dry and oil-immersion
objectives, and commencing with small air angles, progress
up to 180&deg; air angle, and then take an oil-immersion of 82&deg; and
progress again to 180&deg; oil angle, the ratio of opening to power
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
progresses also, and attains its maximum, not in the case of the air
angle of 180&deg; (when it is exactly equivalent to the oil angle of only
82&deg;), but is greatest at the oil angle of 180&deg;. If we assume the
objectives to have the same power throughout we get rid of one of
the factors of the ratio, and we have only to compare the diameters
of the emergent beams, and can represent their relations by diagrams.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_35">Fig. 35</a> illustrates five cases of different apertures of &frac14;-in. objectives,
viz.: those of dry objectives of 60&deg;, 97&deg;, and 180&deg; air angle,
a water-immersion of 180&deg; water angle, and an oil-immersion of
180&deg; oil angle. The inner dotted circles in the two latter cases are
of the same size as that corresponding to the 180&deg; air angle.</p>

<p>A dry objective of the maximum air angle of 180&deg; is only able to
utilise a diameter of back lens equal to twice the focal length, while
an immersion lens of even only 100&deg; utilises a <i>larger</i> diameter, <i>i.e.</i>,
it is able to transmit more rays from the object to the image than
any dry objective is capable of transmitting. Whenever the angle
of an immersion lens exceeds twice the critical angle for the immersion
fluid, <i>i.e.</i>, 96&deg; for water or 82&deg; for oil, its aperture is in excess of
that of a dry objective of 180&deg;.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_36" src="images/fig_36.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 36.</p></div>

<p>This excess will be <i>seen</i> if we take an oil-immersion objective of,
say 122&deg; balsam angle, illuminating it so that the whole field is
filled with the incident rays, and use it first on an object not mounted
in balsam, but dry. We then have a <i>dry objective</i> of nearly 180&deg;
angular aperture, for, as will be seen by reference to <a href="#fig_36">Fig. 36</a>, the
cover-glass is virtually the first surface of the objective, as the front
lens, the immersion fluid, and the cover-glass are all approximately
of the same index, and form, therefore, a front lens of extra thickness.
When the object is close to the cover-glass the pencil radiating from
it will be very nearly 180&deg;, and the emergent pencil (observed by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
removing the eye-piece) will be seen to utilise as much of the back
lens of the objective as is equal to twice the focal length, that is, the
<i>inner</i> of the two circles at the head of <a href="#fig_35">Fig. 35</a>.</p>

<p>If now balsam be run in beneath the cover-glass so that the angle
of the pencil taken up by the objective is no longer 180&deg;, but 122&deg;
only (that is, <i>smaller</i>), the diameter of the emergent pencil is <i>larger</i>
than it was before, when the angle of the pencil was 180&deg; in air, and
will be approximately represented by the <i>outer</i> circle of <a href="#fig_35">Fig. 35</a>. As
the power remains the same in both cases, the larger diameter denotes
the greater aperture of the immersion objective over a dry objective
of even 180&deg; angle, and the excess of aperture is made plainly
visible.</p>

<p>Having settled the principle, it is still necessary, however, to
find a proper <i>notation</i> for comparing apertures. The astronomer
can compare the apertures of his various objectives by simply
expressing them in inches, but this is obviously not available to
the microscopist, who has to deal with the ratio of two varying
quantities.</p>

<p>In consequence of a discovery made by Professor Abbe in 1873,
that a general relation existed between the pencil admitted into
the front of the objective and that emerging from the back of the
objective, he was able to show that the ratio of the semi-diameter
of the emergent pencil to the focal length of the objective could be
expressed by the formula <i>n</i> Sin <i>u</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, by the sine of half the angle
of aperture (<i>u</i>) multiplied by the refractive index of the medium (<i>n</i>)
in front of the objective (<i>n</i> being 1·0 for air, 1·33 for water, and 1·52
for oil or balsam).</p>

<p>When, then, the values in any given cases of the expression <i>n</i> Sin <i>u</i>
(which is known as the “numerical aperture”) has been ascertained,
the objectives are instantly compared as regards their aperture, and,
moreover, as 180&deg; in air is equal to 1·0 (since <i>n</i> = 1·0 and the sine
of half 180&deg; = 1·0) we see, with equal readiness, whether the aperture
is smaller or larger than that corresponding to 180&deg; in air. Thus,
suppose we desire to compare the apertures of three objectives, one
a dry objective, the second a water immersion, and the third an oil
immersion; these would be compared on the angular aperture view
as, say 74&deg; air angle, 85&deg; water angle, and 118&deg; oil angle, so that a
calculation must be worked out to arrive at the actual relation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
between them. Applying, however, the <i>numerical</i><a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> notation, which
gives ·60 for the dry objective, ·90 for the water immersion, and
1·30 for the oil immersion, their relative apertures are immediately
recognised, and it is seen, for instance, that the aperture of the water
immersion is somewhat less than that of a dry objective of 180&deg;, and
that the aperture of the oil immersion exceeds that of the latter
by 30%.</p>

<p>The advantage of immersion, in comparison with dry objectives,
becomes at once apparent. Instead of consisting merely in a diminution
of the loss of light by reflection or increased working distance,
it is seen that a wide-angled immersion objective has a larger aperture
than a dry objective of maximum angle, so that for any of the
purposes for which aperture is essential an immersion must necessarily
be preferred to a dry objective.</p>

<p>That pencils of identical angular extension but in different media
are different physically, will cease to appear in any way paradoxical
if we recall the simple optical fact that rays, which in air are spread
out over the whole hemisphere, are in a medium of higher refractive
index such as oil <i>compressed</i> into a cone of 82&deg; round the perpendicular,
<i>i.e.</i>, twice the critical angle. A cone exceeding twice the
critical angle of the medium will therefore embrace a <i>surplus</i> of rays
which do not exist even in the hemisphere when the object is in air.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>The whole aperture question, notwithstanding the innumerable
perplexities which heretofore surrounded it, is in reality completely
solved by these two simple considerations: First, that “aperture” is
to be applied in its ordinary meaning as representing the greater or
less capacity of the objective for receiving and transmitting rays; and
second, that when so applied the aperture of an objective is determined
by the ratio between its opening and its focal length; the
objective that utilises the larger back lens (or opening) relatively
to its focal length having necessarily the larger aperture. It would
hardly, therefore, serve any useful purpose if we were here to
discuss the various erroneous ideas that gave rise to the contention
that 180&deg; in air must be the maximum aperture. Amongst
these was the suggestion that the larger emergent beams of
immersion objectives were due to the fact that the immersion
fluid abolished the refractive action
of the first plane surface which, in
the case of air, prevented there being
any pencil exceeding 82&deg; within the
glass. Also the very curious mistake
which arose from the assumption that
a hemisphere did not magnify an
object at its centre because the rays passed through without refraction.
A further erroneous view has, however, been so widespread
that it seems to be desirable to devote a few lines to it, especially as
it always appears at first sight to be both simple and conclusive.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_37" src="images/fig_37.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 37.</p></div>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_37a" src="images/fig_37a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 37<i>a</i>.</p></div>

<p>If a dry objective is used upon an object in air, as in <a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a>, the
angle may approach 180&deg;, but when the object is mounted in balsam,
as in <a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a><i>a</i>, the angle at the object cannot exceed 82&deg;, all rays
outside that limit (shown by dotted lines) being reflected back at the
cover-glass and not emerging into air. On using an immersion
objective, however, the immersion fluid which replaces the air above
the cover-glass allows the rays formerly reflected back to pass
through to the objective, so that the angle at the object may again
be nearly 180&deg; as with the dry lens. The action of the immersion
objective was, therefore, supposed to be simply that it repaired the
loss in angle which was occasioned when the object was transferred
from air to balsam, and merely restored the conditions existing in
<a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a><i>a</i> with the dry objective on a dry object.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p>As the result of this erroneous supposition, it followed that an
immersion objective could have no advantage over a dry objective,
except in the case of the latter being used upon a balsam-mounted
object, its aperture then being (as was supposed) “cut down.” The
error lies simply in overlooking the fact that the rays which are
reflected back when the object is mounted in balsam  <a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a><i>a</i>) are
not rays which are found when the object is in air (<a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a>), but
are <i>additional and different</i> rays which do not exist in air, as they
cannot be emitted in a substance of so low a refractive index.</p>

<p>Lastly, it should also be noted that it is numerical and not angular
aperture which measures the quantity of light admitted to the
objective by different pencils.</p>

<div class="table w100">
<div class="tcell w50">
<img id="fig_38" src="images/fig_38.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 38.</p></div>

<div class="tcell w50">
<img id="fig_38a" src="images/fig_38a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 38<i>a</i>.</p></div></div>

<p>First take the case of the medium being the same. The popular
notion of a pencil of light may be illustrated by <a href="#fig_38">Fig. 38</a>, which
assumes that there is equal intensity of emission in all directions, so
that the quantity of light contained in any given pencils may be
compared by simply comparing the contents of the solid cones. The
Bouguer-Lambert law, however, shows that the quantity of light
emitted by any bright point varies with the obliquity of the direction
of emission, being <i>greater</i> in a perpendicular than in an oblique
direction. The rays are less intense in proportion as they are more
inclined to the surface which emits them, so that a pencil is not
correctly represented by <a href="#fig_38">Fig. 38</a>, but by <a href="#fig_38">Fig. 38</a><i>a</i>, the density of the
rays decreasing continuously from the vertical to the horizontal, and
the squares of the sines of the semi-angles (<i>i.e.</i>, of the numerical
aperture) constituting the true measure of the quantity of light
contained in any solid pencil.</p>

<p>If, again, the media are of different refractive indices, as air (1·0),
water (1·33), and oil (1·52), the total amount of light emitted over
the whole 180&deg; from radiant points in these media under a given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
illumination is not the same, but is <i>greater</i> in the case of the media
of greater refractive indices in the ratio of the squares of those
indices (<i>i.e.</i>, as 1·0, 1·77 and 2·25). The quantity of light in pencils
of different angle and in different media must therefore be compared
by squaring the product of the sines and the refractive indices, <i>i.e.</i>
(<i>n</i> Sin <i>u</i><sup>2</sup>), for the square of the numerical aperture.</p>

<p>The fact is therefore made clear that the aperture of a dry objective
of 180&deg; does not represent, as was supposed, a maximum, but that
aperture increases with the increase in the refractive index of the
immersion fluid; and it should be borne in mind that this result has
been arrived at in strict accordance with the ordinary propositions
of geometrical optics, and without any reference to or deductions
from the diffraction theory of Professor Abbe.</p>

<p>There still remains one other point for determination, namely, the
proper function of aperture in respect to immersion objectives of
large aperture. The explanation of the increased power of vision
obtained by increase of aperture was, that by the greater obliquity
of the rays to the object “shadow effects” were produced, a view
which overlooked the fact, first, that the utilisation of increased
aperture depends not only on the obliquity of the rays sent to the
<i>object</i>, but also to the <i>axis of the microscope</i>; and exactly as there is no
acoustic shadow produced by an obstacle, which is only a few multiples
of the length of the sound waves, so there can be no shadow produced
by minute objects, only a few multiples from the light waves, the latter
then passing completely <i>round</i> the object. The Abbe diffraction
theory, however, supplies the true explanation of this, and shows that
the increased performance of immersion objectives of large aperture
is directly connected (as might have been anticipated) with the larger
“openings” in the proper sense of the term, which, as we have already
explained, such objectives really possess. Furthermore, in order that
the image exactly corresponds with the object, all diffracted rays
must be gathered up by the objective. Should any be lost we shall
have not an actual image of the object, but a spurious one. Now, if
we have a coarse object, the diffracted rays are all comprised within
a narrow cone round the direct beam, and an objective of small
aperture will transmit them all. With a minute object, however,
the diffracted rays are widely spread out, so that a small aperture can
admit only a fractional part&mdash;to admit the whole or a very large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
part, and consequently to see the minute structure of the object, or
to see it truly, a large aperture is necessary, and in this lies the value
of <i>aperture</i> and of a <i>wide-angled immersion objective</i> for the observation
of minute structures.</p>

<h3>Numerical Aperture.</h3>

<p><b>Measure of Apertures of Objectives. N.A.</b>&mdash;Numerical
aperture, as it is termed, is measured by the scale of measurement
calculated by the late Professor Abbe, and which has since been
generally recognised and adopted. He showed that even in lenses
made for the same medium (as air) their comparative aperture as
compared with their focus was not correctly measured by the angle of
the rays grasped, but by the actual diameters of the pencil of rays
transmitted, which depend, as already seen, more upon the back of
the lens than the front. To get a geometric measure for comparison,
he took the radii, or half diameters (whose relative proportions
would be the same), and which geometrically are the sines of
the semi-angle of the outermost rays grasped. Abbe further showed
that if this sine of half the outside angle were multiplied by the
refractive index of the medium used we should have a number which
would give the comparative <i>aperture</i> of any lens, whatever the
medium. This number, then, determines both the numerical aperture
and the resolving power of the objective.</p>

<p>The following table of numerical apertures shows the respective
angular pencils which they express in air, water and cedar oil, or
glass.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> The first column gives the numerical apertures from 0·20
to 1·33; the second, third, and fourth, the air, water and oil
(or balsam) angles of aperture from 23&deg; 4′ air angle to 180&deg; balsam
angle. The theoretical resolving power in lines to the inch is shown
in the sixth column; the line E of the spectrum being taken from
about the middle of the green, the column giving “illuminating
power” being of less importance; while in using that of penetrating
power, it must be remembered that several data beside that of <sup>1</sup>/<sub><i>a</i></sub> go
to make up the total depth of vision with the microscope.

<h3>Abbe’s Apertometer.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_39" src="images/fig_39.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 39.&mdash;Abbe’s Apertometer.</p></div>

<p>The apertometer is an auxiliary piece of apparatus invented by
Abbe, for testing the fundamental properties of objectives and determining
their numerical and angular apertures. This accessory of the
microscope involves the same principles as that of Tolles, which the
late Mr. J. Mayall and myself brought to the notice of the Royal
Microscopical Society of London in 1876. Abbe’s apertometer
(<a href="#fig_39">Fig. 39</a>) consists of a flat cylinder of glass, about three inches in
diameter, and half an inch thick, with a large chord cut off, so that the
portion left is somewhat more than a semicircle; the part where the
segment is cut is bevelled from above downwards, to an angle of 45&deg;,
and it will be seen that there is a small disc with an aperture in it
denoting the centre of the semicircle. To use this instrument the
microscope is placed in a vertical position, and the apertometer is
placed upon the stage with its circular part to the front and the
chord to the back. Diffused light, either from the sun or lamp, is
assumed to be in front and on both sides. Suppose the lens to be
measured is a dry one-quarter inch; then with a one-inch eye-piece
having a large field, the centre disc, with its aperture on the apertometer,
is brought into focus. The eye-piece and the draw-tube
are now removed, leaving the focal arrangement undisturbed, and
a lens supplied with the apertometer is screwed into the end of the
draw-tube. This lens, with the eye-piece in the draw-tube, forms
a low-power compound microscope. This is now inserted into the
body-tube, and the back lens of the objective whose aperture we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
desire to measure is brought into focus. In the image of the back
lens will be seen stretched across, as it were, the image of the
circular part of the apertometer. It will appear as a bright band,
because the light which enters normally at the surface is reflected
by the bevelled part of the chord in a vertical direction, so that in
reality a fan of 180&deg; in air is formed. There are two sliding screens
seen on either side of the figure of the apertometer; they slide on
the vertical circular portion of the instrument. The images of these
screens can be seen in the image of the bright bands. <i>These screens
should now be moved so that their edges just touch the periphery of the
back lens.</i> They act, as it were, as a diaphragm to cut the fan and
reduce it, so that its angle just equals the aperture of the objective
and no more.</p>

<p>This angle is now determined by the arc of glass between the
screens; thus we get an angle in <i>glass</i> the exact equivalent of the
aperture of the objective. As the numerical apertures of these arcs
are engraved on the apertometer, they can be read off by inspection.
A difficulty is not infrequently experienced from the fact that it is
not easy to determine the exact point at which the edge of the
screen touches the periphery of the back lens, or rather the limit of
the aperture. Zeiss, to meet this difficulty, made a change in the
form of the apparatus&mdash;furnished a glass disc mounted on a metal
plate, with a slot for the purpose of its more accurate adjustment.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<h3>Stereoscopic Binocular Vision.</h3>

<p>Professor Wheatstone’s remarkable discovery of stereoscopic vision
led, at no distant period, to the application of the principle to the
microscope. It may therefore prove of interest to inquire how
stereoscopic binocular vision is brought about. Indeed, the curious
results obtained in the stereoscope cannot be well understood without
a previous knowledge of the fundamental optical principles involved
in this contrivance, whereby two slightly dissimilar pictures of any
object become fused into one image, having the actual appearance of
relief. The invention of the stereoscope by Sir Charles Wheatstone,
F.R.S., 1838, and improved by Brewster, was characterised by
Sir John Herschel as “one of the most curious discoveries, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
beautiful for its simplicity, in the entire range of experimental
optics,” led to a more general appreciation of the value of the
conjoint use of both eyes in conveying to the mind impressions of
the relative form and position of an object, such as the use of either
eye singly does not convey with anything like the same precision.
When a near object having three dimensions is looked at, a different
perspective representation is seen with each eye. Certain parts are
seen by the right eye, the left being closed, that are invisible to the
left eye, the right being closed, and the relative positions of the
portions visible to each eye in succession differ. These two visual
impressions are simultaneously perceived by both eyes, and combined
in the brain into one image, producing the effect of perspective and
relief. If truthful right-and-left monocular pictures of an object be so
presented to the two eyes that the optic axes when directed to them
shall converge at the same angle as when directed to the object
itself, a solid image will be at once perceived. The perception of
relief referred to is closely connected with the doubleness of vision
which takes place when the images on corresponding portions of the
two retina are not similar. But, if in place of looking at the solid
object itself we look with the right and left eyes respectively at
pictures of the object corresponding to those which would be formed
by it on the retina of the two eyes if it were placed at a moderate
distance in front of them, and these visual pictures brought into
coincidence, the same conception of a solid form is generated in the
mind just as if the object itself were there.</p>

<p>Professor Abbe, however, contended that the method by which
dissimilar images are formed in the binocular microscope differs
materially from that of ordinary stereoscopic vision, and that the
pictures are united solely by the activity of the brain, not by the
prisms which ordinarily give rise to sensations of <i>solidity</i>. This can
be only partially true, as binocularity in the microscope is due to
difference of projection exhibited by the different parallax displacement
of the images, and also to the perception of depth imparted by
the instrument.</p>

<p>Wheatstone was firmly convinced that his stereoscopic principle
could be applied to the microscope, and he therefore applied first to
Ross and then to Powell to assist him in its adaptation. But
whether either of these opticians made any attempt to give effect to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
his wishes and suggestions is not known. In the year 1851 Professor
Riddell, of America, succeeded in constructing a binocular microscope
by employing two rectangular prisms behind the objective. M. Nachet
also constructed a binocular with two body-tubes and a series of
prisms. But neither Riddell’s nor Nachet’s instrument was ever
brought into use; they were either too complicated or too costly.</p>

<p>It will be understood, however, that the binocular stereoscope
combines two dissimilar pictures, while the binocular microscope
simply enables the observer to look with both eyes at images which
are essentially identical. Stereoscopic vision, to be effective, requires
that the delineating pencil shall be equally separated, so that one
portion of the admitted cone of light is conducted to one eye, and
the other portion to the other eye.</p>

<p>Select any object lying in an inclined
position, and place it in the centre of the
field of view of the microscope; then, with
a card held close to the object-glass, stop off
alternately the right or left hand portion of
the front lens: it will then appear that
during each alternate change certain parts
of the object will change their relative
positions.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_40" src="images/fig_40.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 40.&mdash;Portions of
Eggs of Cimex.</p></div>

<p>To illustrate this, <a href="#fig_40">Fig. 40</a> <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> are
enlarged drawings of a portion of the egg of the common bed-bug
(<i>Cimex lecticularis</i>), the operculum which should cover the opening
having been forced off at the time the young was hatched. The
figures exactly represent the two positions that the inclined orifice
will occupy when the right- and left-hand portions of the object-glass
are stopped off. This object is viewed as an opaque object,
and drawn under a two-thirds object-glass of about 28&deg; aperture.
If this experiment is repeated, by holding the card over the eye-piece,
and stopping off alternately the right and left half of the
ultimate emergent pencil, exactly the same changes and appearances
will be observed in the object under view. The two different
images just produced are such as are required for obtaining
stereoscopic vision. It is therefore evident that if instead of
bringing them confusedly together into one eye we can separate
them so as to bring together <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> into the left and right eye, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
combined effect of the two projections we obtain at once all that is
necessary to enable us to form a correct judgment of the solidity and
distance of the several parts of the object.</p>

<p>Nearly all objectives from the one inch upwards of any considerable
aperture give images of the object seen from a different point of
view with the two opposite extremes of the margin of the cone of
rays; the resulting effect is that there are a number of dissimilar
perspectives of the object blended together at one and the same time
on the retina. For this reason, if the object under view possesses
bulk, a more accurate image will be obtained by reducing the
aperture of the objective.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_41" src="images/fig_41.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 41.</p></div>

<p>Diagram 3, <a href="#fig_41">Fig. 41</a>, represents the method employed by
Mr. Wenham for bringing the two eyes sufficiently close to each
other to enable them both to see through the double eye-piece at
the same moment. <i>a a a</i> are rays converging from the field lens of
the eye-piece; after passing the eye-lens <i>b</i>, if not intercepted, they
would come to a focus at <i>c</i>; but they are arrested by the inclined
surfaces, <i>d d</i>, of two solid glass prisms. From the refraction of the
under incident surface of the prisms, the focus of the eye-piece
becomes elongated, and falls within the substance of the glass at <i>e</i>.
The rays then diverge, and after being reflected by the second
inclined surface <i>f</i>, emerge from the upper side of the prism, when
their course is rendered still more divergent, as shown by the figure.
The reflecting angle given to the prisms is 47&frac12;&deg;, to accommodate
which it is necessary to grind away the contact edges of the prisms,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
as represented, otherwise they prevent the extreme margins of the
reflecting surfaces from coming into operation, which are seldom
made quite perfect.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_42" src="images/fig_42.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 42.&mdash;Professor Abbe’s Stereoscopic Eye-pieces.</p></div>

<p><a href="#fig_42">Fig. 42</a> represents a sectional view of Abbe’s stereoscopic eye-pieces,
which consist of three prisms of crown glass, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>b′</i>, placed
below the field-glass of the two eye-pieces; the tube <i>c</i> is slipped into
the tube or body like an ordinary eye-piece. The two prisms <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
are united so as to form a thick plate with parallel sides, inclined to the
axis at an angle of 38·5&deg;. The cone of rays from the objective is
thus divided into two parts, one being transmitted and the other
reflected; that transmitted passing through <i>a b</i> and forming an
image of the object in the axial eye-piece <small>B</small>. Adjustment for different
distances between the eyes is effected by the screw placed to
the right-hand side of the figure, which moves the eye-piece <small>B′</small>,
together with the prism <i>b′</i>, in a parallel direction. The tubes can
also be drawn out, if greater separation is required. The special
feature of this instrument is that on halving the cone of rays by
turning the caps, an orthoscopic or pseudoscopic effect is produced.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
This double-eyed piece arrangement of Abbe’s has not been at all
brought into use in this country; this is partly owing to its original
adaptation for use with the shorter Continental body-tube of
160 mm., and not for our 10-inch body.</p>

<p>The most perfect method of securing pleasing satisfactory stereoscopic
vision of objects is that devised by Mr. Wenham. In his
binocular microscope an equal division of the cone of rays, after
passing through the objective is secured and again united in the
eye-pieces, which act as one, so that each eye is furnished with an
appropriate and simultaneous view of the object. The methods
contrived by the earlier experimenters not only materially interfered
with the definition of the objective and object, but also required
expensive alterations and adaptations of the
microscope, and sometimes separate stands
for their employment. Mr. Wenham’s invention,
on the contrary, offers no such obstacle
to its use, and the utility of the microscope
as a <i>monocular</i> is in no way impaired either
when using the higher powers.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_43" src="images/fig_43.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 43.</p></div>

<p>The most important improvement, then,
effected by Wenham consists in the splitting
up or dividing the pencil of rays proceeding
from the objective by the interposition of
a prism of the form shown in <a href="#fig_43">Fig. 43</a>. This is placed in the
body or tube of the microscope so as to interrupt only one-half
(<i>a c</i>) of the pencil, the other half (<i>a b</i>) proceeding continuously to
the field-glass, eye-piece, of the principal body. The interrupted
half of the pencil on its entrance into the prism is subjected to
very slight refraction, since its axial ray is perpendicular to the
surface it meets. Within, the prism is subjected to two reflections
at <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, which send it forth again obliquely on the line <i>b</i>
towards the eye-piece of the secondary body, to the left-hand side
of the figure; and since at its emergence its axial ray is again
perpendicular to the surface of the glass, it suffers no further
refraction on passing out of the prism than on entering. By this
arrangement, the image sent to the right eye is formed by rays
which have passed through the left half of the objective; whilst
the image sent to the left eye is formed by rays which have passed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
through the right half, and which have been subjective to two
reflections within the prism, and passing through two surfaces of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
glass. The prism is held by the ends only on the sides of a small
brass drawer, so that all the four polished surfaces are accessible,
and should slide in so far that its edge may just reach the central
line of the objective, and be drawn back against a stop, so as to
clear the aperture of the same.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_44" src="images/fig_44.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 44.&mdash;Sectional view of the Wenham Binocular.</p></div>

<p>The binocular, then (<a href="#fig_44">Fig. 44</a>), consists of a small prism mounted
in a brass box <small>A</small>, which slides into an opening immediately above the
object-glass, and reflects one-half of the rays which form an image
of the object, into an additional tube <small>B</small>, attached at an inclination
to the ordinary body <small>C</small>. One half of the rays take the usual course
with their performance unaltered; and the remainder, though
reflected twice, show no loss of light or definition worthy of notice,
if the prism be well made.</p>

<p>As the eyes of different persons are not the same distance apart,
the first and most important point to observe in using the binocular
is that each eye has a full and clear view of the object. This is
easily tried by closing each eye alternately without moving the head,
when it may be found that some adjustment is necessary by racking
out the draw-tubes <small>D</small>, <small>E</small>, of the bodies by means of the small milled
head near the eye-pieces; this will increase the distance of the
centres; and, on the contrary, the tubes, when racked down, will
suit those eyes that are nearer together.</p>

<p>If the prism be drawn back till stopped by the small milled
head, the field of view in the inclined body is darkened, and the
rays from the whole aperture of the object-glass pass into the main
body as usual, neither the prism nor the additional body interfering
in any way with the use of the instrument as a monocular
microscope.</p>

<p>The prism can be withdrawn altogether for the purpose of being
wiped: this should be done frequently, and very carefully, on all
four surfaces, with a perfectly clean cambric or silk handkerchief
or a piece of wash-leather; but no hard substance must be used.
During this process the small piece of blackened cork fitted between
the prism and the thick end of the brass box may be removed; but
it must be carefully replaced in the same position, as it serves an
important purpose in stopping out extraneous light.</p>

<p>As the binocular microscope gives a real and natural appearance
to objects, this effect is considerably increased by employing those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
kinds of illumination to which the naked eye is accustomed. The
most suitable are all the opaque methods where the light is thrown
down upon the surface; but for those objects that are semi-transparent,
as sections of bone or teeth, diatomace&aelig;, living aquatic
animalcules, &amp;c., the dark-field illumination by means of the parabolic
reflector will give an equally good result.</p>

<p>For perfectly transparent illumination, it is much better to diffuse
the light by placing under the object various substances, such as
tissue-paper, ground glass, very thin porcelain, or a film of yellow
bees’ wax, run between two pieces of thin glass.</p>

<p>To ensure the full advantage and relief to both eyes in prolonged
observations with high as well as low powers, and with objectives of
large aperture, Mr. Wenham devised a compound prism for use with
his binocular microscope, the body tubes of which are also made
expressly to suit the prism, as extreme accuracy is necessary to
bring them into proper position. The main prism somewhat
resembles in form the ordinary Wenham prism. Over the first
reflecting surface is placed a second smaller prism, the top plane
of which is parallel with the base of the first, so that direct rays
pass through without deviation, but at the two inclined surfaces of
the prisms (nearly in contact) there is a partial reflection from each,
which, combined, give as much light as in the direct tube. The
reflected image from these two surfaces is directed up into the
inclined tube as usual. A somewhat later improvement is that of
Dr. Schroeder, the high power prism, by means of which the
whole of the rays emanating from the objective pass through it,
and the full aperture of any power is thereby effectively utilised.
Furthermore, Messrs. Ross have also constructed a right- and left-hand
pair of eye-pieces, which ensure greater perfection of the
image. It was, in fact, noticed that the size of the image in the
left-hand field glass slightly differed from that of the right when
examined by the ordinary Huyghenian eye-pieces. To compensate
for this difference, the left-hand eye-piece has been carefully calculated,
and its focus is now so accurately adjusted that the position
of each eye in observing is brought into one plane of the binocular.
The pairs of the several series of eye-pieces <small>A</small>, <small>B</small> and <small>C</small> have also been
altered, and the effect is to greatly improve the image and give
increased comfort to the observer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>Dr. Carpenter, who warmly espoused the binocular, and constantly
employed it in his work, very truly said of it: “The important
advantages I find it to possess are in penetrating power, or focal
depth, which is in every way superior to that of the monocular
microscope, so that an object whose surface presents considerable
inequalities is very much more distinctly seen with the former than
with the latter.”</p>

<p>This difference may in part be attributed to the practical modification
in the angle of aperture of the objective, produced by the
division of the cone of rays transmitted through the two halves, so
that the picture or image received through each half of the objective
of 60&deg; is formed by rays diverging at an angle of only about 30&deg;.
He confesses, however, that this does not satisfactorily explain the
fact that the binocular brings to the <i>mind’s</i> eye the <i>solid</i> image of
the object, and thus gives to the observer a good idea of its form
and which could hardly be obtained by the monocular microscope.
Carpenter cites in support of his views the wing of a little-known
moth, <i>Zenzera Œsculi</i>, which has an undulating surface, whereon the
scales are set at various angles instead of having the usual imbricated
arrangement, a good object for demonstrating; the general inequality
of surface and the obliquity of its scales, which are at once seen by
the binocular with a completeness not obtained by the monocular
instrument.</p>

<p>To one unaccustomed to work with the binocular the views
expressed by Dr. Carpenter as to the extreme value of the instrument
for ordinary work may appear somewhat exaggerated, but from
my own experience, having long had in constant use a Ross-Zentmayer
binocular, furnished with a special prism, constructed for working
with a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub> dry objective or a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub> immersion, the perfection of picture
obtained was in every case quite equal to that of the monocular
microscope. The relief to the eyes can hardly be over-estimated; the
slight inequality of the pencil rays may be regarded rather as a part
of the welcome rest afforded when a prolonged examination is made;
it certainly appears to me to equalise the slight physiological
difference known to exist between the eyes of most people. If one
image is seen a little clearer by the stronger eye, the weaker eye
assists rather more the stereoscopic effect of the object under
observation. The advantage gained by the binocular is perhaps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
more appreciated when opaque objects are under examination, as the
eggs of insects, and the tongue of the blow-fly, specimens of mosses,
lichens, parasites (vegetable and animal), whose planes and inequalities
of surface require penetration, and which usually demand more
time for their observation.</p>

<img id="fig_45" src="images/fig_45.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 45.&mdash;Swift-Stephenson’s Erecting Binocular.</p></div>

<p>No variation or change of any kind proposed either in the form
of the instrument or the prism has proved of sufficient value or
importance to bring it into use, and therefore Wenham’s instrument
is scarcely likely to be superseded. It must be admitted that the
improvement effected in the eye-piece form by Mr. Tolles, of
Boston, U.S., is an exception to the rule laid down. It consists
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
in mounting the prisms in a light material, vulcanite, made to fit
into the monocular microscope body, thus taking the place of the
ordinary eye-piece. The image transmitted by the objective is
brought to a focus on the face of the first equilateral triangular
prism by the intervention of an erector-eye-piece inserted beneath
it. The second set of prisms have a rack and pinion movement
to adjust them to any visual angle. The illumination of both
fields in this eye-piece is nearly equal in brightness. Mr. Stephenson’s
erecting binocular (<a href="#fig_45">Fig. 45</a>) has proved to be of some practical
value. It has the advantage of being of equal use with high and
low powers, and with little loss of definition. When used for
dissecting purposes it gives an erect image of the object. It is
equally useful as a working microscope, for arranging diatoms and
botanical specimens of every kind. The sub-stage tube will receive
a diaphragm or illuminating apparatus; the eye-pieces have a
sliding adjustment for regulating the widths between eyes.</p>

<h3>Simple and Compound Microscope.</h3>

<p>Microscopes are known as simple and compound. The simple
microscope may, for convenience, be divided into two classes; those
used in the hand (hand magnifiers), and those provided with a stand
(mounted, as it is termed) for supporting the object to be viewed,
together with an adjustment for the
magnifying power, and a mirror for
reflecting the light through the
object.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_47" src="images/fig_47.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 47.&mdash;Visual Angle.</p></div>

<p>A <i>simple microscope</i>, mounted, is
preferable to a single lens, being
usually composed of two or more
lenses separated by a small distance
on a common axis; the increase of
the size of an object being the angle
it subtends to the eye of the observer,
or the angle formed by the combination drawn from the axis of
vision to the extremity of the object, as in <a href="#fig_47">Fig. 47</a>. The lines
drawn from the eye to a and r form an angle, which, when the
distance is small, is nearly twice as large as the angle from the
eye to o w, formed by lines drawn at twice the distance. This
is called the angle of vision, or the visual angle. Now, the
utility of a convex lens interposed between a near object and
the eye consists in its reducing the divergence of the rays forming
the several pencils issuing from it, so that they enter the eye in
a state of moderate divergence, as if they were issuing from an
object beyond the near point of distinct vision, and a well-defined
image is thereby formed upon the retina. In the next <a href="#fig_48">Fig. (48)</a>, a
double-convex lens illustrates the action of the <i>simple microscope</i>, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
small arrow being the object brought under view, and the large
arrow the magnified image. The rays having first passed through
the lens are bent into nearly parallel lines, or pencils diverging from
some point within the limits of distinct vision. Thus altered, the
eye receives rays precisely as if they had emanated directly from
a larger arrow placed about ten inches away from it. The difference
between the real and the imaginary object represents the magnifying
power of the lens. The object in this case is magnified nearly in
the proportion the focal distance of the lens bears to the distance
of the object when viewed by the unassisted eye; and this is due to
the object being more distinctly viewed so much nearer to the eye
than it otherwise could be without the lens.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_48" src="images/fig_48.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 48.&mdash;Virtual Image formed by Convex Lens.</p></div>

<p>It should be remembered that the shorter the focus and the nearer
the eye the magnifying lens is placed the smaller will be the diameter
of the sphere of which it forms a part, and unless its aperture be
proportionally reduced, the distinctness of the image will be
destroyed by the spherical and chromatic aberrations of its high
curvature. Nevertheless, it was by the use of lenses so constructed
that the older microscopists&mdash;of whom Leeuwenhoek was the more
eminent&mdash;were enabled to do so much excellent work.</p>

<p>The various kinds of simple pocket lenses for the most part
consist of a double-convex, or a plano-convex, or a combination of
both, varying in focal length from a quarter of an inch to two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
inches. Sometimes they are set in pairs with a hole, a small
diaphragm, cut in the piece of horn placed between them. These
are extremely useful for carrying in the waistcoat pocket; to the
anatomist and field botanist for examining various objects and
preparations.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_49" src="images/fig_49.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 49.&mdash;Wollaston’s Doublet.</p></div>

<p>Perhaps the most important improvement effected in this form
of the simple microscope was that ascribed to the celebrated
Dr. Wollaston, who devised a doublet of two plano-convex lenses
having their focal lengths, in the proportion of one to three,
mounted with their convex side directed towards the eye of the
observer, and the lens of shorter focal length next the object. The
explanation given of the correction thus effected in Dr. Wollaston’s
doublet will be best understood on reference to the annexed
diagram, <i>l l′</i>, in <a href="#fig_49">Fig. 49</a>, being the object for a segment of the
cornea of the eye, and <i>d d′</i> the stop or diaphragm. Now, it will be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
seen that each pencil of light proceeding from <i>l l′</i>, the object, is
rendered excentrical by the limiting aperture or the diaphragm
<i>d d</i>; consequently, they pass through the lenses on opposite sides
of their common axis <i>o p</i>; thus each becomes affected by opposite
errors, which to some extent balance and correct each other. To
take the pencil <i>l</i>, for instance, as it enters the eye at <i>r b</i>; <i>r b</i> is
bent to the right at the first lens, and to the left at the second;
and as each bending alters the direction of the blue ray more than
the red, and as the blue ray falls nearer the margin of the second
lens, where the refraction is greater than that nearer the centre, and
compensates to some extent for the greater focal length of the second
lens, the blue rays will emerge very nearly parallel, and colourless
to the eye. At the same time, its spherical aberration has been
diminished, since the side of the pencil as it proceeds through one
lens passes nearer the axis, and in the other nearer the margin.</p>

<p>This must be taken to apply to pencils farthest from the centre
of the object. Central rays, it is obvious, would pass both lenses
symmetrically, the same portions of rays occupying nearly the same
relative places in both lenses. The blue ray would enter the second
lens nearer its axis than the red; and being thus less refracted than
the red by the second lens, some amount of compensation would
take place, differing in principle, and inferior in degree, to that
which is found in the excentrical pencils. In the intermediate
spaces the corrections are still more imperfect and uncertain; and
this explains the cause of aberrations which must of necessity exist
even in the best-made doublet. It is, however, infinitely superior to
a single lens, and will transmit a pencil of an angle of from 35&deg;
to 50&deg;.</p>

<p>The next step towards improving the simple microscope was in
relation to the eye-piece, and was effected by Holland. It consisted
in substituting two lenses for the first in the doublet, and placing a
stop between them and the third. The first bending of the pencils
of light being effected by two lenses instead of one, produces less
spherical and chromatic aberration, which are more nearly balanced
or corrected at the second bending, and in the opposite direction, by
the third lens.</p>

<p>Another form of simple lens was devised by Dr. Wollaston, the
“Periscopic.” This combination consists of two hemispherical lenses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
cemented together by their plane faces, with a stop between them to
limit the aperture. A similar proposal, made by Sir David Brewster
in 1820, is known as the Coddington lens,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> shown at <a href="#fig_50">Fig. 50</a>: this
has a somewhat larger field, and is equally balanced in all directions,
as is made evident, the pencils <i>a b</i> and <i>b a</i> passing through
under precisely the same circumstances. Its spherical form has the
further advantage of rendering the position in which it is held of
comparatively little consequence. It is still used as a hand magnifier,
although its definition is certainly not so good as that of a well-made
doublet. It is usually set in a folding case, as represented in the
figure, and so contrived as to be admirably adapted for the waistcoat-pocket.
It is usually sold with the small <i>holder</i>, <a href="#fig_50">Fig. 50</a><i>a</i>, for
holding and securing small objects during examination. Browning’s
Platyscopic Pocket Lens is a useful form of pocket lens for the
botanist and mineralogist. Its focus is nearly three times longer
than that of the Coddington, and allows of opaque objects being
more easily examined; it has also a magnifying power of 15, 20,
and 30 diameters.</p>

<img id="fig_51" src="images/fig_51.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 51.&mdash;Steinheil’s
Aplanatic Lens.</p></div>

<p>One of the best combinations of the hand or pocket form of lens
is that known as <i>Steinheil’s aplanatic lens</i> (<a href="#fig_51">Fig. 51</a>); it consists of a
bi-convex lens cemented between two concavo-convex
lenses, giving a relatively long focal
distance and a large flat field. The higher
powers of this lens are much used for dissecting
purposes. This handy magnifier
appears to have suggested a later combination,
the apochromatic of Zeiss. No hand
lens can compare with Steinheil’s “<i>loups</i>.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_52" src="images/fig_52.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 52.&mdash;Simple Microscope.</p></div>

<p>When the magnifying power of a lens is
considerable, or when its focal length is short, or it is wished to use
it with greater precision and steadiness, it should be mounted on
a short stand with a tubular stem, with rack-work focussing movement
and mirror illumination. <a href="#fig_52">Fig. 52</a> represents a simple dissecting
microscope, with a glass circular stage, 4&frac12; inches in
diameter, supported on three legs&mdash;a handy and useful form of
instrument for many purposes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<h3>The Compound Microscope.</h3>

<p>The compound microscope differs from the simple, inasmuch as the
image is formed by an object-glass, and further magnified by one or
more lenses forming an eye-glass. For a microscope to be a compound
one, its essential qualification is that it should have an
object-glass or objective, and an eye-glass or eye-piece, so called
because they are respectively near the object and the eye of the
observer when the instrument is in use. The microscope consists
of a tube or <i>body</i>, and a <i>stand</i>, an arrangement for carrying the
<i>body</i>, combined with which is a <i>stage</i> for holding the object, and
a <i>mirror</i> for its illumination. To the more modern instrument
has been added a substage, to carry a condenser and other
accessories.</p>

<p>The <i>body</i> of a microscope, which carries the system of magnifying
lenses, must be placed at one particular distance from the object,
termed the <i>focus</i>, in order that a clear image may be obtained.
For the purpose of <i>focussing</i> two motions are supplied, the one
for <i>coarse adjustment</i>, with lower powers; the other for higher
powers, termed the <i>fine adjustment</i>. It is in this wise that the
magnifying power of the compound microscope is turned to good
account.</p>

<p>There are, however, limits to the use to which lenses can be put
with advantage in the direction of magnifying the object, just as
there are in varying the magnifying power of the eye-glass. Defects
in either, although not first seen, that is, when the image is but
moderately enlarged, are brought into prominence by greater amplification.
In practice, therefore, it is found to be of advantage to
vary the power by employing object-glasses of different values (foci).
In whatever way increase of amplification is brought about, two
things will always result from the change: the proportion of surface
of the object of which an image can be formed must be diminished,
and the amount of light spread over the image proportionally
lessened.</p>

<p>In addition to the two lenses mentioned, it was found to be of
considerable advantage to introduce a third lens between the object-glass
and the image formed by it at eye-piece, the purport of
which is to change the course of the rays (bend in the pencil)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
so that the image may not be found of too great a dimension for
the whole to be brought within the circumference of the eye-glass.
This, it will be readily seen, allows more of the
object to be viewed at the same time by the
<i>field-glass</i>, as the eye-piece of the microscope is
termed.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_53" src="images/fig_53.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 53.</p></div>

<p><a href="#fig_53">Fig. 53</a> represents the body of an ordinary
compound microscope with its triplet object-glasses;
o is an object, above it is the triple
achromatic object-glass, in connection with the
eye-piece <i>e e, f f</i> the plano-convex lenses; <i>e e</i> being
the eye-glass, and <i>f f</i> the field-glass, between
which, at <i>b b</i>, the arrow represents the diaphragm.
The course of the light is shown by
three rays drawn from the centre, and three
from each end of the object <i>o</i>; these rays, if not
prevented by the lens <i>f f</i>, and the diaphragm
<i>b b</i>, would form an image at <i>a a</i>; but here, as
they meet with the lens <i>f f</i> in their passage,
are converged by it at <i>b b</i>, the diaphragm at <i>b b</i>
intercepting a portion of peripheral rays, permitting
only those to pass that are necessary
for the formation of the image, the further
magnification of which is, however, here brought
about by the eye-glass <i>e e</i>, precisely as if it were
that of the original object under examination.
It will be apparent, then, that the field-lens <i>f f</i>
belongs in principle to the object-glass, or
objective, taking a share in the image-forming rays, although this is
taken to be a part of the eye-piece.</p>

<h3>Evolution of the Modern Achromatic Microscope.</h3>

<p>The great advances made in the optical arrangements of the
modern microscope necessitated important changes and improvements
in its several mechanical parts. Indeed, as the apertures of
objectives became increased, and focal planes became correspondingly
shallower, it was absolutely necessary to apply a more sensitive
system of focussing than that for many years past commonly in use.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
The leading manufacturers at once grasped the situation, and in a
short space of time the older model microscopes were discarded, and
replaced by instruments better in workmanship and finish, and in
every way more suitable for the student and the promotion of
original scientific research.</p>

<p>From an early period English amateurs appear to have bestowed
greater attention on the improvement of the microscope than those
of any other country. Between 1820 and 1835 Tully, Pritchard,
Dolland, James Smith, Andrew Ross, and Hugh Powell, encouraged
by Wollaston, Brewster, Goring, Herschel, and Lister, worked out
innumerable combinations of single and compound lenses to be
employed as simple microscopes, explained in a previous chapter.</p>

<p>The theories propounded about this time for the improvement of
lenses and the various combinations for amateurs were not of lasting
value. Nevertheless, they were not wholly made in vain, as during
the last twenty years they have indirectly borne good fruit, inasmuch
as by working in another direction Professor Abbe was led to the
discovery of new and better kinds of glass, by which the secondary
spectrum has been so nearly eliminated, and the optical parts of the
microscope so materially improved. In pursuing this subject I
would not have it supposed that Continental opticians were either
idle or supine. On the contrary, Oberh&auml;user, Fraunhofer, Chevalier,
Nachet, Hartnach, and others took an active part in the work.</p>

<p>The compound microscope made for anatomists by the first-named
optician about 1825 has not been entirely superseded. He was the
first to make a rotating stage, to apply mechanism to focussing, and
to introduce the system of direct push or pull of the condenser tube
within the sub-stage socket. Nachet made other improvements on
the Oberh&auml;user microscope by applying under the stage a tail-piece
having a dove-tailed groove in which a slide carrying the sub-stage
was moved by a stud-pin. More recently the lever movement
was superseded by American opticians, who made other changes.
Hartnach ultimately very much improved Oberh&auml;user’s model, and
this remains with us.</p>

<p>The English modern compound microscope, together with the achromatic
objective, we owe to a mind teeming with scientific inventions,
Joseph Jackson Lister, F.R.S., who in 1826 supplied Mr. Tully,
a well-known London optician of that period, with original drawings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
for the important improvements in its mechanical details and accessory
apparatus which followed so soon afterwards.</p>

<p>Among the many ingenious novelties enumerated in his published
papers we find the graduated lengthening of the body-tube of the
microscope; a stage-fitting for clamping and rotating the object;
a subsidiary stage; a dark-well, and a large disc to incline and rotate
opaque objects; a ground-glass light moderator; a live-box with
bevelled flat-glass plate; an erector-eye-piece; an adapter for using
Wollaston’s camera lucida for microscopical drawing; and, above all,
a combination of lenses to act as a condenser under the object
(evidently the first approach to the present achromatic sub-stage
condenser). The value of the erector-eye-piece for facilitating
dissections under the microscope is not even yet sufficiently appreciated.
Tully published a descriptive account of Lister’s microscope,
the first one of which he made, and acknowledged his indebtedness
to “Mr. Lister’s ingenuity and skill.” Shortly afterwards Lister made
known his discovery of the two aplanatic foci in a double achromatic
object glass, and gave verbal directions to the three principal makers
of microscopes in London, James Smith, Andrew Ross, and Hugh
Powell, for the future construction of the achromatic objective, all
of whom were intent on the improvement of their several models.
To the latter the Society of Arts awarded, in 1832, a medal for his
improved mechanical stage movements, on the “Turrell system,”
which Powell first constructed for Edmund Turrell. This stage was
made to rotate completely on its optic axis by means of an obliquely-placed
pinion acting on a bevelled rack on the inner face of the
stage-ring supporting the mechanism. In 1834 Powell once more
received a Society of Arts medal, “the Iris,” for improvements in
the application of a new form of fine adjustment.</p>

<p>About the same date (1835) Andrew Ross introduced the socket-carrier
of the body-tube of the microscope on a strong stem, with
rack bent in the middle, thus affording space for a larger stage.
He likewise devised the hollow cross-bar, placed at right angles to
the rack-stem, whereby he was enabled to use a new system of fine
adjustment, consisting of a delicate screw with large milled head,
acting by a point on the long arm of a lever, the short arm of
which ends in a fork in contact with a stud placed on either
side of a cylindrical sliding tube forming the nose-piece of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
body-tube, and into which the objective is screwed. A spiral spring
presses down the nose-piece, and against this the screw and
lever act.</p>

<p>This appears to have been the first really sensitive focussing
method applied to the nose-piece; it was, and probably is, one of
the most delicate systems ever applied to the microscope. It has
enjoyed a long period of popularity, and I believe it still survives in
Powell and Lealand’s instruments, which are very generally admitted
to be of superior excellence for all purposes where extreme delicacy
of focussing is an essential element.</p>

<p>The rival system of fine adjustment&mdash;the short lever and screw
applied externally to the body-tube&mdash;known as the Lister-Jackson
system, which appears to have been contrived to allow the body-tube
to be supported more firmly on the limb or stem, has had its
merits ably realised in the microscopes of Smith and Beck and their
successors, but, except as modified by the successors of Andrew Ross
(Schrœder’s form), it is, I believe, admitted that it has been superseded
by other modifications lately introduced into the Ross-Jackson
instrument.</p>

<p>The year 1830 was, however, a propitious period in the history of
the modern microscope, as in January of that year Mr. Lister
published his epoch-making paper, “On the Improvement of the
Achromatic Microscope.” This appeared together with certain personal
practical directions (for no man was ever more anxious to
communicate his knowledge than Mr. Lister) to the before-mentioned
opticians, which led up to changes lasting until 1840, when, by the
efforts of this gentleman and his personal friends, “The Microscopical
Society of London” came into existence. Among the more
prominent members of the Society was Mr. George Jackson, a name
still well known to microscopists, and who, jointly with Mr. Lister,
gave us the Jackson-Lister form of microscope. This was forthwith
accepted as a perfect model. Soon after Andrew Ross effected a
further change in the instrument, shown in <a href="#fig_54">Fig. 54</a> in its complete
form as left by this optician. It is here represented as having a bar
movement, with a claw foot bolted to two uprights to carry the
trunnions with the body and stage. This base, is insufficiently wide
and extended to carry so large an instrument with its centre of
gravity so high. The coarse adjustment bar also was rectangular,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
and the fine adjustment a lever, with the milled head in the middle
of the bar, which involved a certain amount of tremor; withal it
was an instrument of excellent workmanship, and its defects were
not regarded as irremediable. Messrs. Ross, however, preferred to
construct an entirely new model designed by Zentmayer, the “Ross-Jackson-Zentmayer,”
to which I shall refer presently. A later model,
however, has to some extent taken its place, “the Histological and
Bacteriological Microscope,” <a href="#fig_55">Fig. 55</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_54" src="images/fig_54.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 54.&mdash;An early Ross-Jackson Microscope.</p></div>

<p>My reference to the older form of instrument is chiefly with the
view of directing attention to the sensitive focussing system, applied
in the first instance to the nose-piece; now placed below the coarse
adjustment. It certainly is a delicate form of fine adjustment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
This model possesses other points of interest well worth preserving,
which fully entitle it to occupy the prominent place given in the list of
the house of Ross. In the Ross-Jackson “Histological and Bacteriological
Microscope” much attention seems to have been given to
eliminate certain weak points in the earlier Ross-Jackson model&mdash;defects
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
still extant in stands of certain English and foreign makers&mdash;while
retaining the more practical improvements of both constructions.
Steadiness is secured by an extension of the tripod or claw-foot
and the shorter and more solid uprights that sustain the whole
weight of the instrument.</p>

<p class="hang">Fig. 56.&mdash;Powell and Lealand’s Students’ Microscope, with Amici prism

<p>The Ross-Jackson, then, survives, together with the original tripod
stand of Hugh Powell’s, upon which he expended all the resources
of the practical optician, and applied the early principles involved in
the Lister-Jackson instrument, but from different points of view.
However, there is hardly a choice between one and the other in
workmanship, both opticians having furnished microscopes of a
typical class and very high order. The firm of Powell and Lealand
have but one form of stand, from which they have never been
tempted to deviate. It is supported on a true tripod base, forming
a solid and substantial support to the body, which is of such a length
as to give as nearly as possible the standard optical interval of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
10 inches between the posterior principal focus of the objective and
the anterior focus of the eye-piece; the variation in the optical tube
length does not exceed a quarter of an inch with objectives of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
&frac12; inch and upwards. The arm on which the body is fixed is
5&frac34; inches long, which not only gives a clearance of 3&frac12; inches from
the optic axis, but also permits of the introduction of a long fine-adjustment
lever.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_57" src="images/fig_57.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 57.&mdash;Powell’s larger No. 2 Instrument.</p></div>

<p class="hang">Fig. 58.&mdash;Powell and Lealand’s Students’ Microscope arranged for direct
illumination. <i>A.</i> Secondary or Sub-stage racked up to bring the
Achromatic Condenser close to the object.</p></div>

<p>The cross arm encloses the lever mechanism for the fine adjustment,
as originally devised by Andrew Ross. This cross arm is
longer than that used by Ross, and carries the body more forward,
so as to provide radial space for the complete rotation of the stage
and the optic axis, and at the same time the lever of the adjustment
is lengthened, and delicacy of motion secured. The stage retains
the mechanical movements invented by E. Turrell, and first applied
by Hugh Powell. It also rotates completely by means of an
obliquely placed pinion acting on a bevelled rack on the inner
face of the stage-ring supporting the mechanism. Finders are
engraved on the plates, and the main support of the stage-ring is
graduated for angle measuring, a pointer on the ring marking the
unit of motion in arc.</p>

<p>The <i>sub-stage</i> is carried by rack-work, and has rectangular
centring movements, supporting an inner socket that can be
rotated by rack and pinion, and which carries the several sub-stage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
accessories. A fine adjustment, by screw-cone and stud, is applied
by means of an extra slide.</p>

<p>The <i>stage</i> is attached to the sheath of the stem by a special
arrangement of screws, by which the rotation in the optic axis can
be centred; sliding spring clips and a movable and a removable and
adjustable angle-piece to hold the slides are applied on the upper
surface. The body-tube is pivoted to move laterally on the top of
the stem, and an adjustable steel stud beneath serves to stop the
movement in the axis. Such is Powell’s present instrument, and it
represents the results of sixty years’ steady devotion to secure perfection,
and at the same time embody the best ideas of mechanical
design by Andrew Ross.</p>

<p>A cheaper form of students’ microscope is furnished by Powell and
Lealand, with &frac34;-inch stage movement, coarse and fine adjustments
to body, plane and concave mirrors, revolving diaphragm, two eye-pieces,
and Lister’s dark wells. These makers also adopt a gauge of
tubing, the size being such that it will take in a binocular body,
a Huyghenian 2 inch eye-piece having the largest field-glass possible.
The tube of the sub-stage is the same size, so as to secure one gauge
of tubing throughout. This allows of a Kellner or other eye-piece
to be used as a condenser.</p>

<h3>Ross’s Microscopes.</h3>

<p>Messrs. Ross have more recently introduced several changes and
modifications in the Zentmayer stand, all tending to improve it, so
that the Ross-Zentmayer model takes its place as a first-class
microscope.</p>

<p>Messrs. Ross have lately manufactured other forms of microscopes;
one especially designed for those commencing the study of
bacteriology (<a href="#fig_59">Fig. 59</a>). This instrument is one of the steadiest among
those lately constructed for high-class work. The circular foot and
short stout pillar support the whole instrument, and a substantial
knee-joint sustains the full weight in the upright or inclined
positions, while the centre of gravity is by no means disturbed, and
absolute steadiness secured. The stage is of the horse-shoe form,
which affords convenient space for the fingers to lift the slide up
while the oil is placed in contact with the objective. The fine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
adjustment is extremely sensitive, working smoothly and direct; this
is entirely covered, to prevent injury by dust. The micrometer
screw works directly in the centre of its fittings, the milled
head being divided to read to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>500</sub> of an inch. The sub-stage is
fitted with a new centring coarse and fine adjustment, so that when
using high powers with the Abbe condenser accurate focus can be
secured with the least amount of trouble.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_59" src="images/fig_59.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 59.&mdash;Ross’s “Bacteriological and Histological” Microscope.</p></div>

<p>The amount of activity shown during the last few years by
opticians in the manufacture of new forms of microscopes renders it
somewhat difficult to keep pace with improvements, some of which are
novel. A further source of congratulation is that economy has all
along been studied; so much so, that the instruments in question
are within the reach of persons of moderate means. Messrs. Ross
and Co. have taken a new departure in this respect, and their <i>“Eclipse”
Microscope</i> is an entirely new form of stand with a ring foot. This
microscope has been produced for the especial use of students, and
can be purchased for a moderate sum. It will be seen at a glance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
(<a href="#fig_60">Fig. 60</a>) how steady this form of stand must necessarily be, since
the centre of gravity is secured in every direction and inclination.
The body-tube carries eye-pieces, numbered, of the Continental size
and optical tube-length (160 mm.), for which the object glasses are
adjusted, and a draw-tube extending to eight inches.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_60" src="images/fig_60.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 60.&mdash;Ross’s Rigid Pattern
“Eclipse” Microscope.</p></div>

<p>The fine adjustment is independent of set screws, and not subject
to derangement. It is extremely sensitive and direct in action, and
from its construction is equal in
perfection of working to the best
that can be made. Its fitting,
by a new contrivance, is completely
covered at all points,
being thus preserved from disturbance
or injury by dust.</p>

<p>The Eclipse is furnished with
two eye-pieces, 1′′ and &frac14;′′ object
glasses of highest excellence and
large angular aperture, both
adjusted to a double nose-piece,
so that they focus in the same
plane; and a swinging mirror
and stage iris diaphragm.</p>

<p>In “Wenham’s Radial” Microscope
the chief aim has been
directed towards providing a
very considerable range of effects,
both in altitude and azimuth.
The leading principle followed
throughout in the construction
of this form of stand is that of facilitating the work of the
microscopist and of obtaining the maximum range of oblique
illumination in all directions. This is fairly well attained by
causing all the movements of inclination and rotation to radiate
from the object as a common centre. Thus it has been found
possible to combine seven radial motions, so that when the instrument
is inclined backwards, as in <a href="#fig_61">Fig. 61</a>, or placed in the horizontal,
as in <a href="#fig_62">Fig. 62</a> or rotated from in the brass plate, a pencil of light
from a fixed source shall always reach the object and pass to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
objective. The stage is made to rotate completely, and its rectangular
motions are effected by milled heads acting entirely within
the circumference. The sub-stage is mounted on the Zentmayer
system, with two centring screws,
by means of which the optic axis
is secured. It is also provided
with rectangular and rotating
motions. The coarse adjustment
is that of the Ross-Jackson form&mdash;a
spiral pinion and diagonal
rackwork, while the fine is on an
entirely new principle designed
by Dr. H. Schrœder.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_61" src="images/fig_61.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 61.&mdash;Ross’s Wenham Radial
Microscope.</p></div>

<p>The “Ross-Zentmayer Microscope”
is a thoroughly substantial
and practical instrument, combining
elegance of appearance with
strength and firmness.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_62" src="images/fig_62.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 62.&mdash;The Ross-Wenham Radial
Microscope.</p></div>

<p>It is a true tripod model, consisting
of a triangular base with two pillars rising from a cross-piece,
which carries the trunnions. The slow movement is obtained
by a second slide close behind
the first; but to avoid the
friction of rubbing surfaces,
hardened steel rollers are
inserted between them, which
give a frictionless fine motion,
amenable to the slightest
touch of the milled-head screw
situated conveniently at the
back of the limb, through
which a steel lever passes
which actuates the slow motion
slide. The body of the instrument is therefore not touched during
the fine focussing, so that all lateral movement is avoided. The
mechanical stage rotates axially, and the outer edge of the lower plate
is divided into degrees, in order to register the angles; a simple mode
of adjustment is provided for setting the centre of rotation exactly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
coincident with the focal point of the objective. As the plates of
the stage have no screw or rackwork between them (these are placed
externally), they are brought close together, thus affording the
advantage of a thin substantial stage, and ensuring rigidity where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
most required; phosphor-bronze being used in its construction. The
stage is attached to the limb by a conical stem, with a screw and
clamp nut at the back, so that it can be easily removed for the substitution
of a simple plate or other stage; by turning the stem in the
socket the stage may be tilted sideways at any angle required.
A feature in the Ross-Zentmayer stand is the swinging sub-stage
and bar carrying the mirror, having its axis of rotation situated
from an axial point in the plane of the object, which consequently
receives the light without requiring alteration of focus in any
position of the bar; by this means facilities are afforded for the
resolution of objects requiring oblique light and for the development
of their structure. Rays are thus obtained from any angle and
indicated by the graduated circle round the top of the swing-bar,
and many troublesome and expensive pieces of sub-stage apparatus
dispensed with. The value of this arrangement was long ago
recognised in Grubb’s “Sector Stand,” the movement of which was
obtained in a far less efficient manner.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_63" src="images/fig_63.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 63.&mdash;The Improved Ross-Zentmayer Model.</p></div>

<p>The base or foot of the Ross-Zentmayer instrument is made in
one piece. Preference must be given to the double pillar support, as
this is firmer, and allows the sub-stage to swing free while the
microscope is in a vertical position, as in working with fluid preparations.
The sub-stage is provided with screws for centring, and,
when determined, secured by a clamping screw.</p>

<p>The sub-stage, with its apparatus in place, can be instantly
removed, by being drawn out sideways, so as to use the mirror
alone, which is a great convenience.</p>

<p>The mechanical movements of this instrument are perfect, and
well adapted to their purpose.</p>

<p>Messrs. Ross have other typical forms of microscopes. Their
<i>“New Industrial” Microscope</i>, for the use of farmers, horticulturists,
textile and other trades, for the examination of produce and raw
materials, is a surprisingly cheap one, and deserving of commendation.
The great utility of microscopical research to purposes of
advanced agriculture is fully recognised, and a less costly instrument
than that usually supplied for more complex investigations was
much needed. It is provided with a broad square stage for the
purpose of receiving a glass dish to contain liquids or manifold
objects, and which may be moved on the stage to bring the various
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
particles under observation. A fitting beneath the stage carries
a plate with diaphragm apertures for modifying the light, and as
seeds, textile fibres, and other opaque objects form a large portion
of those to be examined, this sub-stage plate has a space between
the perforations which, when brought into position, provides a dark
ground by preventing the passage of light from underneath. A condensing
lens is, however, provided for the better lighting of opaque
objects. Here we have a microscope which combines efficiency with
stability, while its very simplification allows of a really good and
effective instrument for the small sum of &pound;3 3<i>s.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Fig. 64.&mdash;Ross’s “New Industrial” Microscope.</p></div>

<h3>Messrs. Beck’s Microscopes.</h3>

<p>Messrs. Beck have adopted what may be termed a rival system of
fine adjustment in their modern microscopes. The short lever and
screw applied externally to the body tube is peculiar, I may say, to
the Ross-Jackson system, and was originally devised to allow of the
body tube being supported somewhat more firmly on the limb.
This change had its merits fully realised in the early microscopes
of Smith and Beck. To their successors, R. &amp; J. Beck, the microscope
owes much, and very many important improvements, while all
their instruments and accessories are excellent examples of good
workmanship and finish. In their <i>Pathological Microscope</i> we have
a movement originally found in Tolles’ microscopes: a vertical
disc, by which the centre can be raised or depressed to correspond
with the thickness of the slide. The stage can also be brought into
an inverted position by rack and pinion. Their fine adjustment
has been greatly improved, as we shall presently see, whereby it has
been made more sensitive and delicate of adjustment. The general
construction of their microscopes as a rule possess the following
advantages: the stands are strong, firm, and yet not too light or too
heavy, the instruments cannot alter from the position in which they
are placed, as, unfortunately, will occasionally happen when joints
work loose; in every position the heavier part of the stand maintains
the centre of gravity.</p>

<p>Beck’s <i>Pathological Microscope</i> (<a href="#fig_65">Fig. 65</a>) is a nearly perfect instrument,
furnished with a firm triangular foot, which ensures great
steadiness in any position. It has a well adapted joint for placing
the instrument at any angle of inclination; coarse adjustment by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
spiral rack and pinion; fine adjustment by delicate lever and micrometer
screw motion; rack and pinion focussing and screw centring
sub-stage, made to carry all condensers and other sub-stage
apparatus; mechanical stage with horizontal and vertical traversing
motions. The stage is attached to the instrument by two screws
and can therefore be removed at pleasure, leaving a large square
flat glass stage for the culture-plate. It is likewise provided with
finder divisions, and as it always fits on to the same place, any
particular portion of the object can be recorded and found at any
moment. The triple nose-piece is a convenient addition, and a very
acceptable one to the student while diligently engaged in histological
research.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p></div>

<p><i>Beck’s Large “Continental Model” Microscope</i> is of superior finish.
It is provided with a substantial horse-shoe foot, which gives support to
the strong, well-balanced body, jointed for giving the microscope any
angle of inclination. The body is provided with a draw-tube which
can be racked down to the Continental measurement. It has a spiral
rack and pinion coarse adjustment, and
a fine adjustment of the most perfect
workmanship, which will be described
in detail presently. It has a large
square stage with vulcanite top plate
to receive culture preparations. The
sub-stage is of the most approved
form for centring, and carries an
achromatic or Abbe condenser, iris
diaphragm, &amp;c. The double mirror
can be swung out of place for direct
illumination and micro-photography.
Altogether, this instrument is in every
way fitted for critical or class-room
work.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_67" src="images/fig_67.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 67.&mdash;Beck’s “New Fine
Adjustment.”</p></div>

<p>To return to the fine adjustment of
this, as of other forms of Messrs. Beck’s
microscopes, the applied mechanism of
which is believed to be one of the
most sensitive and delicate character
yet contrived. It is constructed as
shown in the accompanying figure.
The body of the instrument is supported
upon the barrel D D; this
barrel is accurately and smoothly
fitted to the triangular core E E. At the top of barrel D D is
screwed the cap G, to which is attached the rod C; this rod passes
through the centre of the core E E and connects with the lever
arm A at B. The action of the spring J, which is wrapped spirally
around the rod C, raises the body of the microscope and holds the
lever arm A tightly against the screw arm F. The slightest motion,
therefore, of the screw F is communicated through the lever A and
the rod C to the body of the microscope.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>The great delicacy of this arrangement will be appreciated when
it is noticed that the distance from I H is double the distance of I B,
therefore any motion at B is only half that at H. This adjustment
is one of the most delicate made for use with high powers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_68" src="images/fig_68.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 68.&mdash;Beck’s National Binocular Microscope.</p></div>

<p>In the construction of Beck’s Binocular National Microscope, the
body is held in a sliding fitting in the limb, and is moved up or
down by means of a rack and pinion motion. This constitutes the
coarse focussing adjustment. The fine adjustment is effected by the
milled head, which acts upon the body by means of a lever inside
the limb. The upper circular surface of the stage is made of glass,
and carries the object holder, which is provided with a ledge and
spring to hold the object by means of the pressure of an ivory-tipped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
screw, so that it can be moved about readily and smoothly. The
pressure of the screw is adjusted by the milled head, which
permits of more or less pressure being made upon the edge of
the object.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_69" src="images/fig_69.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 69.&mdash;Beck’s Star Microscope.</p></div>

<p>When the stage is required for other purposes the object holder
can be unscrewed and removed. Beneath the stage there is a
cylindrical fitting for the reception of a diaphragm, a polariser, or
other apparatus. The mirror, besides swinging in a rotatory semi-circle,
is made to slide up or down the stem. The microscope is
supported by a firm pillar on a tripod base, and the body can be
inclined at any angle convenient for working. A sub-stage can be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
added at any time for the reception of an achromatic condenser
fitted with concentric screws&mdash;a necessity for more delicate microscopical
research work.</p>

<p><i>Beck’s Star Microscope</i> is in every sense a students’ or class-room
instrument. It is firm and well made, with joint for inclination,
large square stage, sliding coarse adjustment and fine adjustment
by micrometer screw, draw-tube, iris diaphragm, double mirror on
swinging crank arm, A or B eye-piece, a one-inch and quarter-inch
objective, the magnifying power of which ranges from 38·5 to 183.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_70" src="images/fig_70.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 70.&mdash;Beck’s Binocular Dissecting Microscope.</p></div>

<p>An early binocular microscope for dissecting purposes was devised
by the late Mr. R. Beck. (<a href="#fig_70">Fig. 70</a>.) This took the form of a simple
instrument built up on a square mahogany base A raised about four
inches upon four brass supports B B, having a large circular stage
plate made to revolve on a second plate, on which the object is
placed and brought under the eye for dissection. On the left hand
side is a milled head rack and pinion K, which acts upon a horizontal
bar I for focussing the magnifying lens. Another bar, R, carries
the prism P and a pair of eye-pieces arranged on the principle of
M. Nachet’s binocular microscope. Mr. Beck preferred to adopt
Wenham’s method of arranging these prisms; that is, by allowing
half the cone of rays to proceed to one eye without interruption,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
while the other half is intercepted by the prisms and transmitted to
the other eye. Beneath the stage is the ordinary mirror L. The
condensing lens M is supported on a separate brass holder let into
one of the supports of the stand. In practice, however, this arrangement
was found inconvenient, and the microscope has therefore not
been brought into general use.</p>

<h3>Messrs. Watson’s Microscopes.</h3>

<p>Among London opticians, the various microscopes manufactured
by Messrs. Watson, of Holborn, are of high finish and good workmanship.
Those specially designed for the use of students possess
merits of their own in their mechanical construction, and also
embody a provision, as indeed do all their instruments, whether for
students or more pretentious work, whereby wear and tear in their
frictional parts can be compensated for by the user himself. This is
effected in a simple but efficient manner. The fittings are sprung,
and screws set just outside the dove-tails. The very slightest turn
of the screws compresses the dove-tails, and a very large amount of
wear can in this way be prevented.</p>

<p>I am glad to notice that Messrs. Watson have adopted certain
standard sizes recommended some time ago by the Royal Microscopical
Society for the diameters of eye-pieces. It would be a
great advantage if the same standard became generally recognised
and brought into use, since it is a matter of much importance to
microscopists.</p>

<p><i>Watson’s Edinburgh Students’ Microscope</i> (<a href="#fig_71">Fig. 71</a>) is a thoroughly
efficient one for all practical purposes, great care having been bestowed
upon its smallest details, and it is not difficult to perceive the reason
of its popularity among students. The tripod form of foot ensures
great steadiness and firmness; the body carries the smaller 0·92 eye-piece,
and with draw-tube closed is of the Continental length. The
draw-tube is graduated to millimetres, and when fully extended the
body measures 10 inches. The stage is provided with mechanical
and rotary movements; the compound sub-stage with centring
screws, rack and pinion to focus, and a means of lifting the condenser
out of the optical axis when not required for use. Notwithstanding,
none of the movements are at all cramped; a clear distance is maintained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
beneath the stage, affording plenty of room for manipulating
the mirror. Both coarse and fine adjustments work with smoothness,
the latter being on Watson’s latest improved principle&mdash;one revolution
of the milled head moves the body <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>300</sub> of an inch. The stage is of
extra large size, to allow of the use of large culture-plates. No
Continental stand of higher price compares with the Edinburgh
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
microscope. Its height when placed in the vertical position is
11&frac12; inches.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_71" src="images/fig_71.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 71.&mdash;Watson’s Edinburgh Students’ Microscope.</p></div>

<p>Fig. 72.&mdash;Sub-stage of Edinburgh Students’ Microscope. This view of underside
of stage of students’ instrument shows the mirror set at an angle for oblique
illumination, and sub-stage turned aside.</p></div>

<p>The various sizes of oculars adopted by opticians and at present
in vogue cause considerable confusion. A standard size is specially
needed for students’ and small microscopes. The standard long used
by Continental manufacturers is 0·92 of an inch. The adoption of
this size would place the eye-piece in the same position as that of
the universal screw for the objective, formulated by the Royal
Microscopical Society many years ago. The desirability of using
standard sizes has been fully recognised by Messrs. Watson and
they are now adapted to most of their microscopes. The English
diameter, 1·35 of an inch, known as the “Ross” size, is retained in
all their microscopes of large size.</p>

<h3>Watson’s Mechanical Draw-tube.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_73" src="images/fig_73.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 73.&mdash;Watson’s Mechanical Draw-tube (full-size).</p></div>

<p>An important feature in connection with the body-tube of Watson’s
Edinburgh Students’ Microscope (as, indeed, in all their fully furnished
instruments) is that they are provided with two draw-tubes;
one moved by rack-work, the other sliding inside the body-tube.
The advantage is, that the body can be made very short or
extremely long, while sufficient latitude can be given to objectives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
corrected for either Continental or English tube-lengths, and to adjusting
the same for thickness of cover-glass by variation of tube length.
Should the cover-glass be thicker than that for which the objective
is corrected, a shorter tube-length is necessary; if thinner, the body
must be lengthened. This is effected by means of the rackwork
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
draw-tube. The length of the body when closed is 142 millimetres
(5<sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub> inches), and when the two draw-tubes are extended, 305 millimetres
(12 inches), being, therefore, shorter than the Continental
and longer than the English tube lengths. Both draw-tubes are
divided into millimetres, and on the rackwork draw-tube a double
scale is engraved, reading continuously from the sliding draw-tube
when fully drawn out, or giving the body length when the rackwork
draw-tube alone is in use. The utility of this mechanical draw-tube
is that it permits of quick manipulation with perfect results.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p></div>

<p>The inside top of the draw-tube is smaller than the remainder,
the former making a fitting for the eye-piece about 1 inch long,
permitting of the tube being blackened inside up to this fitting,
thus minimising reflection. The end of the draw-tube has the
universal screw for using the apertometer, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Watson’s Histological Microscope</i> (<a href="#fig_74">Fig. 74</a>) is a somewhat cheaper
form of instrument, designed for the student; although of plainer
construction it is quite as well made as the costlier model. It is
provided with spiral rack and pinion coarse adjustment, and with
this motion the greatest smoothness is preserved. There is no
backlash, the teeth of the pinion never leaving the rack; so
effective is it that a high power can be perfectly focussed by its
means. It is also furnished with their universal pattern of fine
adjustment. This can be had for &pound;3 3<i>s.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Fig. 75.&mdash;Watson’s Semi-Mechanical Stage.</p></div>

<p>Messrs. Watson have among other accessories of value introduced
in connection with their several microscopes a semi-mechanical
stage, whereby they are enabled to reduce the cost of manufacture.
<a href="#fig_75">Fig. 75</a> is an outline sketch of the same.</p>

<p>This stage is of the horse-shoe shape, with cut-out centre, constructed
of &frac14;-inch brass plate, and measures over all 5&frac14; inches wide
by 4 inches deep. Fitting on the edges of the main stage is a frame
which is actuated vertically by means of a double rack and pinion
from beneath, giving &frac34;-inch of movement, having controlling heads
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
on either side of the stage; on the edges of this mechanical frame
a sliding bar is fitted, consequently movement may be imparted
either by rackwork or by hand. The mechanical movement,
however is in one direction only; but as the bar carries the
object, the worker can easily move the object out horizontally
with the finger. The advantage of this stage is that the whole
surface is perfectly flush, and the pinion heads are below its level,
so that culture plates or continuous sections may be conveniently
examined.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_76" src="images/fig_76.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 76.&mdash;New Centring Underfitting
for Microscope.</p></div>

<p>Another addition of considerable value is the centring underfitting
for students’ microscopes.</p>

<p>This fitting places in the hands of student workers a means of
accurately centring the sub-stage condenser, at a low cost. It
consists of the usual underfitting tube,
having a flange at the top which is
fitted in a box between two plates.
The centring is effected by means of
two screws, which press the flange
against a spring, as in the ordinary
sub-stage centring movement. The
fitting can be adapted to any form
of Messrs. Watson’s and most other
makers of students’ microscopes.</p>

<p><i>Watson’s Bacteriological Improved Van Heurck’s Microscope</i> (<a href="#fig_77">Fig. 77</a>)
is in every way a superior instrument, and it at once conveys a
favourable impression to the practical worker. When set up for
use its many convenient points&mdash;its excellence of workmanship and
the precision of its movements&mdash;seem to imply its special adaptation
for the bacteriological laboratory and for other high-class work where
absolute reliance has to be placed in the results obtained. Every
detail of the instrument is carried out in the best possible manner.
The coarse adjustment is effected by means of a diagonal rack and
spiral pinion, which ensures the smoothest possible motion; while the
fine, the most important movement in the instrument, is made with
an extra long lever, a specialty of Messrs. Watson’s, and which
imparts an extremely slow action: this is now one of the most
delicate and reliable forms of fine adjustment. By its means the
entire body is raised or lowered by means of a milled head fixed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
a screw having a hardened steel point acting on a lever against a
point attached to the body slide, in a dove-tailed fitting about 2&frac12;
inches long. Owing to the position of the controlling milled head
on the limb, it can be worked with either hand. Another feature
of importance is that, in using the fine adjustment the distance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
between the eye-piece and objective remains unaltered. All the
frictional parts of the microscope have spring slots to the dove-tailed
fittings, in which compensating screws are fitted. These are some
few of the more important points, to which much thought and
attention have been given. The body permits also of the use of
objectives of any other optician, since its total length when the
draw tubes are closed up is only 143 mm.; when extended, a
total length of 320 mm. is available. By this means an ample
margin is left for the correction for cover-glass thickness, whether
the objective used be intended for the 160 mm. or 250 mm. tube
length. The height of the microscope when placed in the vertical
position is 13<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub> inches.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_77" src="images/fig_77.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 77.&mdash;Watson’s Improved “Van Heurck Bacteriological” Microscope.</p></div>

<p><i>The Stage.</i>&mdash;A somewhat new design has been used in building this
up so as to reduce vibration to a minimum. The bracket carrying
the stage, instead of being screwed on to the front of the limb, as
is usually done, is made in a solid casting, taking the sub-stage
beneath, and passing into the joint at the top of the foot. The
joint bolt goes through the whole (limb and stage bracket), rendering
the limb stage and sub-stage as firm as if it were one piece; a point
of considerable importance.</p>

<p>The mirrors, which are plain and concave, are mounted on a swing
arm, so that they may be turned aside when direct illumination of
the object is required. On the right hand side also there is a steel
clamping bar for fixing the microscope at any angle of inclination.
The tripod foot, which has superseded most other forms, is adopted.
At the points of contact with the table the feet are provided with
cork pads, which give increased firmness and prevent vibration to
some extent.</p>

<p>The sub-stage is provided with a fine adjustment of similar design
to that employed for the focussing of the objective. It has become
needful to embody such a refinement, in order that sub-stage condensers
of large aperture, such as are in constant use for critical
high-power work, may be adjusted with the same facility and
precision as the objective&mdash;they, in fact, require it if the best work
is to be got out of them. No pains have been spared by Messrs.
Watson to render it absolutely perfect.</p>

<p><i>Watson’s Portable Microscope.</i>&mdash;This instrument is similar in
general detail to the Histological Microscope, but the foot, mirror
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
stem, &amp;c., are made to fold up in exceedingly compact form, and
when set up for use the stand is perfectly rigid. Portable microscopes
are, as a rule, but makeshifts. This, however, is a thoroughly
sound, practical instrument and capable of best work with the
highest power objectives, having good adjustments and universal
size fittings throughout, so that the objectives and apparatus made
for the larger instruments can be employed with it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_78" src="images/fig_78.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 78.&mdash;Watson’s Portable Microscope. Height of instrument when placed
vertically and racked down is 9<sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub> inches.</p></div>

<p><i>Watson’s Petrological Microscope</i> (<a href="#fig_79">Fig. 79</a>) is a modification of
their Edinburgh Students’ pattern, and designed specially for
petrological and mineralogical work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_79" src="images/fig_79.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 79.&mdash;Students’ Petrological Microscope.</p></div>

<p>A polariscope having prisms of large size is supplied with it, the
analyser being fitted in the body, and the polariser in the under-stage
fitting. The latter has a divided circle and a spring catch at
every quarter circle. By removing the polariser and withdrawing
the analyser, for which provision is made, the microscope can be
used for purposes of ordinary research. A Klein’s quartz plate is
fitted beneath the analyser, also in the body of the microscope.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>The stage, which has a glass surface, rotates concentrically, and
has a divided circumferential edge reading by the verniers. The
eye-piece has cross webs to the diaphragm, and when it is desired, an
analyser, having a divided circle fitted with a calc-spar plate, can
be used above the eye-piece, and condenser lenses attached to the
polariser for stereoscopic purposes. All the fittings have the
universal thread, and are interchangeable.</p>

<h3>Messrs. Swift’s Microscopes.</h3>

<p><i>Messrs. Swift’s Microscopes</i> have a well-established reputation for
quality and good workmanship, and therefore can in no way suffer by
comparison when placed beside those of other opticians. One of the
characteristics of Messrs. Swift’s microscopes&mdash;and this runs through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
the whole series&mdash;is that they are all made to a <i>standard</i> gauge, so
that the several parts of the instruments, as well as their accessories,
are interchangeable; the cheaper forms, with those of the first
quality and finish. Should the student, then, start with a No. 1
model, he can at any time build it up, as it were, with the accessories
designed for a No. 3 or 4, that is, for an instrument of double the
price he started with. The optical centre is preserved throughout
the whole series of microscopes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_81" src="images/fig_81.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 81.&mdash;Swinging Leg Attachment of Swift &amp; Son’s Four-Legged
Microscope Stand.</p></div>

<p>The tripod foot has, it appears, taken the place of some of their
other forms of instruments, while their four-legged <i>tripod</i>, if it can
be so designated, is a novelty of quite an unusual character.</p>

<p>The swing leg is attached to the framework of the tripod by the
screw (Fig. A), which is provided with a powerful steel spiral spring,
compressed between two steel collets when the screw is driven home,
as shown in Fig. B.</p>

<p>The expansion of this spring will obviously take up and compensate
automatically any wear and tear that is likely to occur between
the bearing surfaces, and it is therefore impossible for the fitting to
get loose.</p>

<p><i>Swift’s Four-legged Microscope</i> (<a href="#fig_80">Fig. 80</a>) is one possessing great
stability in whatever position it may be placed; the body being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
supported on a horse-shoe platform, from which its four legs spring,
the two front legs being fixed, while the hind legs are pivoted to the
platform. This arrangement of pivoting the hind legs enables the
microscope to adapt itself to any uneven surface, thus keeping it always
in a steady position, while it also reduces the danger of being upset by
any lateral movement of an accidental nature. The feet are studded
with corks, an additional aid to steadiness and fixity for microphotography.
The length of the body from the ocular to the nose-piece
is 6&frac12; inches, and can be extended to 9 or 10 inches by means
of the draw-tube, which has a millimetre graduation. The stage,
which is of horse-shoe shape, is provided with spring clips, to
which a movable mechanical stage can at any time be attached.
The sub-stage partakes of two forms, one being an ordinary fitting,
taking an ordinary condenser; the other, the regular rack and pinion
achromatic condenser with centring adjustments. It has a
diagonal rack and pinion coarse adjustment, the fine adjustment
being made by micrometer screw of the finest character.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_82" src="images/fig_82.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 82.&mdash;Swift’s Spiral Rack and Pinion Coarse Adjustment.</p></div>

<p><a href="#fig_82">Fig. 82</a> is intended to illustrate the advantage of the spiral rack
and pinion which Messrs. Swift fit to their microscopes, in place
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
of the ordinary conventional horizontal rack and pinion movement.
The advantage will at once be seen, since there is more gearing
contact between rack and pinion, thus ensuring durability and
reducing loss of time or back lash to a minimum, with less wear and
tear. The leaves of the pinion also roll into the teeth of the rack by
degrees, ensuring a very much smoother action, which, if properly
made and fitted, prevents the gearing of the two being felt by the
hand whilst focussing.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_83" src="images/fig_83.jpg" alt="" />
<p>Fig. 83.&mdash;Graduated Supplementary
Draw-Tube.</p></div>

<p><a href="#fig_83">Fig. 83</a> is a supplementary draw-tube with rack and pinion movement,
which can be adapted to any of
Swift’s microscopes in place of the ordinary
draw-tube, the size of the thread being
of the same diameter, so as to render all
draw-tubes, as well as other parts of these
instruments, interchangeable. The draw-tube
being divided into millimetres can be
extended from 160 to 250 millimetres.
One advantage of this arrangement is that
the correct adjustment of any objective with
each eye-piece is easily found and recorded
for future observations with the same combination.</p>

<p>Messrs. Swift’s Three-legged Tripod Microscope
(<a href="#fig_86">Fig. 86</a>). In most respects the
description already given of the four-legged
instrument is applicable to this stand.
Although of an apparently different form,
it can be built up, as already explained,
into one of a higher class. It is suitable
in every way for histological investigations. The horse-shoe platform
in this, as in the preceding stand, is extremely serviceable, as it
allows the pillar of the instrument to rest firmly upon it, thus
rendering the stand very rigid.</p>

<p><i>Swift’s Bacteriological Microscope</i> (<a href="#fig_84">Fig. 84</a>), designed by Professor
Wright, of the Army Medical School, Netley, a sufficient warranty
of its excellency and perfect adaptation for bacteriological high-class
work. One of the advantages connected with this microscope is the
facility with which it can be adapted for either high or low power
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
investigation, without the necessity of adding or detaching any
part. The objectives, arranged on a triple nose-piece, are approximately
in focus when revolved into position for immediate use,
thus effecting a saving of time in changing the objective. Moreover,
the nose-piece carrying the objectives is of new construction,
and fitted in such a way that the entry of dust is rendered
impossible.</p>

Under-Stage of same.</p></div></div>

<p>The Abbe condenser, fitted with an iris diaphragm, is mounted
on an eccentric arm, so that it can readily be thrown out of the axis
of the microscope when not required, without having to re-arrange
the focus when again brought into position. The condenser must
be turned aside when plate cultivations and preparations of unstained
bacteria are being looked over for selection of colonies for mounting,
in which case an arm carrying a quadrant with three apertures is
brought into position in place of the condenser, the apertures being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
severally centred by a spring catch and used with oblique light.
This arrangement, shown in <a href="#fig_85">Fig. 85</a>, is seen from the under surface
of the stage. The stage is sufficiently large, so that when Petrie
plates are being examined at the extreme edges there is little fear of
their overbalancing.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_86" src="images/fig_86.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 86.&mdash;Swift’s Histological Students’ Microscope.</p></div>

<p>The fine adjustment is the Swift’s Patent Campbell Differential
Screw, which offers great facilities for delicate focussing with the
highest power objectives. The stand is of the most substantial and
rigid form, and thus ensures the microscope from vibration.</p>

<p>The under-stage of microscope (<a href="#fig_85">Fig. 85</a>) is seen to be of the most
approved form.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_87" src="images/fig_87.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 87.&mdash;Swift’s Advanced Students’ Microscope.</p></div>

<p><i>Swift’s Advanced Students’ Microscope.</i>&mdash;In this microscope
(<a href="#fig_87">Fig. 87</a>) we have a superior instrument for the use of the advanced
student, which may be described as of high mechanical excellence,
well suited for every requirement of work. The stand is the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
well-known tripod form of their Challenger Microscope, and admits
of the instrument being placed at any angle of inclination; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
body is short enough to work with objectives of Continental makers,
and is provided with a draw-tube, to elongate it to the standard of
10 inches, with a diameter of 1<sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub> inch to take the same eye-pieces
as the larger stands. The coarse adjustment is by spiral rack and
pinion; the fine, by a carefully made differential screw motion for
delicate focussing. The stage is of the horse-shoe pattern, to which
a mechanical stage can at any time be adapted, as well as an
achromatic condenser to the sub-stage seen beneath. Here the
student will find the foundation for a superior instrument.</p>

<h3>Messrs. Baker’s Microscopes.</h3>

<p>Of Messrs. Baker’s larger stands, the Improved “Nelson Model,”
No. 2 (<a href="#fig_88">Fig. 88</a>) stand is selected in preference to their more
elaborate No. 1, and their simpler form, No. 3, as a high-class
instrument, and one well suited for fine critical work;
the former being somewhat better, only from having extra adjustments;
the latter possessing no superior advantage over the
“Advanced Students’” Microscope. This microscope is mounted
on a solid tripod foot, which insures stability, whether placed in
a vertical, horizontal, or inclined position; the front toes are slotted,
so that they may be clamped to the base plate of a photo-micrographic
apparatus, first introduced for photo-micrographic work,
and will also be found convenient in ordinary work; as the fine
adjustment milled head is placed at the bottom of the pillar, instead
of at the top, the more usual place. For photo-micrographic work
the advantage is that the strain of the pulley in such apparatus
actuates the fine adjustment, and is less liable to cause vibration of
the instrument. The advantage when the instrument is used for
ordinary work lies in the fact that the weight of the hand is rested
on the top of the tripod, thus admitting of steadier movement of
the milled head. The fine adjustment is obtained by a “Campbell”
differential screw, each revolution of which is equal to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>200</sub> m.m.
The draw-tubes being graduated in m.m., allow of either short or
long tube objectives being used, closing up to 150 m.m. and
extending to 280 m.m., the rack and pinion adjustment to the
lower tube affording a ready means of correction for cover-glass
thicknesses. The eye-piece gauge, as will be seen from its dimensions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
is of large size, being the same as that adopted by Zeiss for his
long tube compensating oculars; smaller eye-pieces can, however,
be adapted at any time.</p>

has rack-work focussing adjustment, and centring screws; a fine
adjustment is added, if desired. On the whole, the instrument is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
suitable for special critical work, and is equally well suited for
photo-micrography.</p>

bar in vertical and horizontal directions <i>for use as finder</i>; G, sub-stage rack and
pinion screw; H and I, centring screws to sub-stage; J, carrier for condenser;
K, mirror with movable arm supported on solid tripod foot.</p></div>

<p>The points of difference between this stand and the No. 1 model
are that in the latter the fine adjustment carries the body only,
and not the rack adjustment; the limb carrying both the body and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
the sub-stage is in one piece, giving, if possible, still greater rigidity;
the rotation of the mechanical stage, which is divided on silver, is
complete, and can be actuated by hand or rack work; it has a
clamping screw and fine adjustment to sub-stage.</p>

<p><i>Baker’s Advanced Students’ Microscope</i> (<a href="#fig_89">Fig. 89</a>) may be described
as a typical instrument, equally suitable for histological work and
that of the advanced student. The intention of the maker in
simplifying the adjustments and reducing the instrument in size,
was to furnish a well-finished portable instrument at a moderate
cost. This object has not been attained by supplying adjustments
of second-rate quality, but by reducing their number to a minimum.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_90" src="images/fig_90.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 90.&mdash;The Mayall Removable Mechanical Stage.</p></div>

<p>The tripod foot of the “Nelson Model” is replaced by a claw foot,
which is in effect a tripod, as it rests on three points; it has not
the same wide spread, but this, far from being a disadvantage,
renders the instrument more portable. It has rack and pinion
coarse and Campbell differential screw fine adjustments, draw-tube
graduated in m.m., extending to 180 m.m., eye-piece gauge the
same as the Continental size, large square open stage to afford the
greater freedom of manipulation; sliding bar with graduations on
bar and stage, which suffice for registering any given field under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
a low power; holes are also drilled in the stage ready to receive
an attachable mechanical stage should it be thought advisable to
add one at a later date. The sub-stage is of the universal size
with rack-work focussing, adjustment, and centring screws.</p>

<p>Messrs. Baker have recently introduced a similar instrument with
swing-out sub-stage and adjustments for compensating for wear and
tear of rack. The stage is also somewhat larger from back to front.</p>

<p>These stands are very suitable for bacteriological research, and
for amateurs wishing to obtain a stand which will carry all the
apparatus they are likely to need, without going to the expense of
the larger models, no better instrument could be desired.</p>

<p>Their “Removable Mechanical Stage” (<a href="#fig_90">Fig. 90</a>) is a modification
of the pattern designed by the late Mr. J. Mayall. The vertical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
movement is by rack and pinion, giving a range of 1<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub> inch. The
horizontal motion of 1&frac12; inch is accomplished by means of a quick-acting
screw. The object is pressed tightly to the stage of the
microscope by means of three points, and the whole of the mechanical
part is firmly clamped by two thumb screws which can be readily
removed. The stage is made to carry slides of any size less than
1&frac34; inch wide.</p>

<p><i>Baker’s Histological Microscope</i> (<a href="#fig_91">Fig. 91</a>) is of a different type to
the preceding, and is intended to represent one of medium power,
affording magnification of about &times; 400 as a maximum. It is
supplied with a diaphragm beneath the stage, without other
illuminating apparatus than that of the mirror. But if the adjustments
of such a stand are good, there is no reason why some form
of sub-stage condenser should not be added, to make the instrument
somewhat more serviceable. There is, however, a rather too limited
space beneath the stage of an instrument of this kind to admit of
a sub-stage condenser, consequently it cannot be said to be suitable
for critical work. For all ordinary students’ work this microscope
is certainly available.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_92" src="images/fig_92.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 92.&mdash;Rousselet’s Tank Microscope.</p></div>

<p>The stand of the Model Histological Microscope has the same
form of foot as the more advanced student’s stand. It is somewhat
lighter, and more portable, a matter of consideration in a student’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
microscope, which often has to be carried to and from a class-room.
It is provided with rack and pinion coarse adjustment, and a
Campbell differential screw fine adjustment, draw-tube, and diaphragm;
the diaphragm carrier being of the universal size, so that
it can be replaced by an Abbe condenser at any time. With the
additions suggested, this instrument can be made equal to those of
a higher standard.</p>

<p>Rousselet’s Tank Microscope (<a href="#fig_92">Fig. 92</a>), for rapidly looking over
pond water and weeds, consists of a jointed arm moving parallel to
the side of the tank to carry an aplanatic lens; the arm is focussed
by means of rack and pinion fixed to the upright of a mahogany
stand, upon which the tank can be placed, or it can be clamped
directly to the tank by means of a screw. This handy form of pond
microscope is made by Messrs. Baker.</p>

<h3>Pillischer’s Microscopes.</h3>

<p>Mr. Pillischer (New Bond Street) is favourably known for the
excellency of his instruments. He has lately brought out several
microscopes of an improved form. His larger model, the “New
International,” consists of a solid, well-built, firm tripod stand
of the Ross-Jackson pattern, which appears to be quite in the
ascendant among London opticians; rack and pinion coarse
adjustment, and a superior micrometer fine adjustment; sub-stage
with centring screws and rack and pinion focussing adjustment; a
new form of sliding pin-hole diaphragm and iris diaphragm; B and
C eye-pieces; <sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub> and <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub> objectives; Abbe condenser, N.A. 1·20; in
every respect a perfect model, neatly packed in a mahogany case,
for a very moderate sum. Mr. Pillischer’s No. 2 (<a href="#fig_93">Fig. 93</a>) “International”
Microscope, being the <i>Army pattern</i> as well as the <i>student’s</i>,
is well adapted for clinical work. A firm tripod stand supports two
dark bronze uprights, with rack and pinion coarse adjustment, <i>e</i>, and
fine adjustment, <i>d</i>, the stage, <i>i</i>, is wide and suitable for clinical
work, and large enough for dissecting upon. The whole instrument
is well made; the coarse adjustment is so good that the one-eighth
inch can be focussed with ease, and without using the fine
adjustment.</p>

<p>For a few shillings extra, a mechanical stage can be added,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
consisting of levers, having an action similar to the movements of a
parallel ruler, which is so easy of adjustment that it can be worked
under the eighth-inch objective with the hands&mdash;an advantage in a
clinical microscope.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 93.&mdash;Pillischer’s “International” Microscope.</p></div>

<p>The following reference letters serve to explain the general
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
construction of the microscope (<a href="#fig_93">Fig. 93</a>):&mdash;<i>a</i>, the eye-piece; <i>b</i>, the
draw-tube; <i>c</i>, the sliding-tube; <i>d</i>, micrometer or fine adjustment;
<i>e e</i>, the coarse adjustment; <i>g</i>, the mirror arm and mirror; <i>h</i>, sub-stage
carrying Abbe condenser; <i>i</i>, the stage with spring-clips; <i>j</i>, objectives
screwed into place and double nose-piece.</p>

<p>The “Kosmos” is Pillischer’s cheaper model. The stand of this
somewhat novel and original microscope is framed entirely of brass
and gun-metal. The fine adjustment is very sensitive and perfectly
steady, admitting of the highest immersion objectives being used.
The optical parts are constructed upon principles consistent with the
latest improvements. It has a claw-foot stand with a semi-circular
arm, which carries the body, with sliding-tube coarse adjustment,
and micrometer screw fine adjustment, with a large square stage
diaphragm and mirror. The instrument is neatly packed in a
mahogany box, together with the A or B eye-piece, 1-inch and
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>5</sub>-inch objectives of good defining and penetrating power, magnifying
from 30 to 380 diameters, in mahogany cabinet, for the moderate
sum of &pound;5.</p>

<p>Pillischer’s Binocular Microscope (<a href="#fig_94">Fig. 94</a>) is constructed on a
plan somewhat intermediate between that of Beck’s and Ross’s
well-known patterns, and in point of finish is equal to any student’s
microscope in use. The semi-circular form given to the arm carrying
the body increases the strength and solidity of the instrument,
although it is doubtful whether it adds to its steadiness when
placed in the horizontal position. The straight body rests for
a great part of its length upon a parallel bar of solid brass
ploughed into which is a groove for the reception of the rack
attached to the body, the groove being of such a form that the
rack is held firmly while the pinion glides smoothly through it.
A steady, uniform motion is thus obtained, which almost renders
the fine adjustment unnecessary. The binocular bodies are inclined
at a smaller angle to one another than in most instruments;
nevertheless, the range of motion given to the eye-pieces by the
rack and pinion enables those whose eyes are widely separated to
use the instrument with comfort. The prism is so well set that it
illuminates both fields with equal intensity. The stage is provided
with rectangular traversing movements to the extent of an inch and
a quarter in each direction. The milled heads which effect these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
are placed on the same axis, instead of side by side, one of them&mdash;the
vertical one&mdash;being repeated on the left of the stage, so that
the movements may be communicated either by the right hand alone
or by both hands acting in concert. The stage-plate has the ordinary
vertical and rotatory motions, but to a much greater extent than
usual; and the platform which carries the object is provided with
a spring clip to secure the object when the stage is placed in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
vertical position. A new form of sub-stage with centring screws is
made to carry the Abbe achromatic condenser, diaphragm, polarising
and other apparatus.</p>

<h3>Continental Microscopes.</h3>

<p><i>Continental Microscopes.</i>&mdash;The better known among continental
opticians are Zeiss, Leitz, Seibert, Reichert and Hartnack. All
seem to have vied with each other in the attainment of perfection
in the manufacture of the most useful forms of microscopes. The
late Carl Zeiss did more for the modern microscope than either of
the opticians referred to above. I therefore take a medium typical
model of his from a long series of highly-finished instruments for
my illustration. Zeiss’s successors have of late endeavoured to
perfect the mechanical details of their instruments in three or four
directions, i.e., fundamental features of the stand, stage arrangements,
means of focussing, and illumination.</p>

<p><i>The Stand.</i>&mdash;The general form of the stand still partakes too
much of the original sameness of type introduced by Oberh&auml;user,
and modified and improved by Hartnack; the “Babuchin” stand
being still in favour with some few makers. The greater firmness
and steadiness of Zeiss’s stand (<a href="#fig_95">Fig. 95</a>) is secured by the horse-shoe
form of foot, which, for the most part, is massive and well adapted to
carry the stout uprights, which support a well-balanced, substantial
body-tube and a graduated draw-tube, circular stage with a vulcanite
disc, 4 inches in diameter; a sub-stage with centring arrangement
for Abbe’s illuminating apparatus, and iris diaphragm and other
diaphragms for use when the condenser is thrown aside. The
mirror is full-sized, plane and concave. The coarse adjustment is
regulated by a rack and pillion movement so perfect that
objectives of medium power can be focussed by it alone. The fine
adjustment is made by micrometer screw, the force exercised by
which is transferred to the movable body by a single contact
between two hardened steel surfaces. This ensures extremely
delicate and uniform motion of the body which carries the tube.</p>

<p>The divisions in the milled head of the screw furnish a means for
the registration of the vertical movements of the tube. In the
latest stands, each division corresponds to an elevation or depression
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
of the tube in the direction of the optic axis of 0·01 mm. By this
means measurements of thicknesses may be made with a considerable
degree of accuracy, the upper and lower surfaces of the object
being successively focussed, and the amount read off on the
milled-head, by the fixed index. In doing this, care must be taken
to make both adjustments by a rotation of the screw in the same
direction. The thickness of an object in air is then equal to the
difference between the two readings. By this means the thickness
of any other substance may be measured&mdash;that, for instance, of the
cover-glass of the object.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_95" src="images/fig_95.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 95.&mdash;Zeiss’s Medium Stand Microscope.</p></div>

<p>The medium tube-length of the microscope is 160 mm. from
the attachment of the objective to the eye-piece end. The
draw-tube admits of the length being increased or diminished,
and this may be read off by means of the millimetre scale engraved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
on the tube. My description of this model also applies to the
higher class microscopes, which will be found in every way well
finished and adapted to biological
and scientific research.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_96" src="images/fig_96.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 96.&mdash;E. Leitz’s Medium-sized
Microscope.</p></div>

<p><i>E. Leitz’s of Wetzlar Microscopes.</i>&mdash;This
optician publishes
a series of twelve high-class forms
of instruments. By preference,
the horse-shoe form of stand
(<a href="#fig_96">Fig. 96</a>) is adopted in the whole
of this maker’s models, the body
being supported on a hinge joint
and clamped over, and fitted with
a circular revolving centred mechanical
stage, attached to the
ordinary stage by means of a set
pin, which fixes the stage in position.
By removing the screw, the
stage can be detached; in this
way, the stage serves for searching
over large surfaces and registering
the results.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_97" src="images/fig_97.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 97.&mdash;Leitz’s Dissecting Microscope.</p></div>

<p>The coarse adjustment is made
by rack and pinion, and the fine
adjustment by micrometer screw, the head of which is provided with
a scale reading <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub> mm. The draw-tube is also cut and ruled
to millimetre scale. The sub-stage has rack and pinion movement,
and is arranged for the Abbe condenser and iris diaphragm. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
is attached to the upper stage by means of a set pin, which fixes
and retains it in position after perfect centring. By removing the
pin, the sub-stage can be either detached or swung aside by
pressing a button. In short, this microscope is in all respects
well furnished and fitted with the requisite complex mechanism
necessitated by modern high-class technicological work.</p>

<p>Leitz’s students’ microscope, with sliding body, micrometer screw
fine adjustment, concave mirror, two eye-pieces and two objectives,
&frac34; inch and <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub> inch, in mahogany case, costs &pound;3 10<i>s.</i> Leitz’s
dissecting microscope, with a heavy foot and rests, is fitted with
two aplanatic lenses, magnifying &times; 10, &times; 20 diameters.</p>

<p><i>Reichert and Seibert</i> adhere to the same model as that of Zeiss,
and therefore require only a brief notice. Their microscopes are
characterised by substantial workmanship, suitable construction,
and exact centring. The coarse adjustment is obtained in the usual
way by rack and pinion, the fine by micrometer screws, which work
easily, and are protected against wear and tear by having their
working surfaces hardened. The stands of the better class
instruments have micrometer screws graduated, and draw-tubes cut
to millimetre scale. Their mechanical stages and sub-stages and
accessories are in every way well finished; stage forceps, tests, and
an assortment of cover glasses and slides being added. Their
first-class microscopes are sent out in mahogany boxes.</p>

<p>On going through the continental makers’ catalogues, it will
be noticed that their well-equipped microscopes are rather more
costly than that of their English <i>confreres</i>. It is understood
Messrs. Baker and Watson are the constituted agents for these
opticians.</p>

<p><i>Nachet’s Microscope</i>, a new form of which was first seen at the
Antwerp Exhibition 1892, is very solidly built, and has all the
qualities necessary for histological work. The stage rotates about
the optic axis, and carries a movable slide holder. The coarse
adjustment is by rack and pinion movement, the fine by the new
system of micrometer screw (described in the journal of the Royal
Microscopical Society of 1886), with divided head indicating the
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>400</sub> part of a mm. The plane and convex mirror is mounted
on a jointed arm. The draw-tube is divided into millimetres.
The illuminating system, consisting of a wide-angled Abbe condenser
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
(N.A. 1·40) with iris diaphragm, is raised or lowered by rack and
pinion screws. The iris diaphragm, being mounted on a wheel, is
worked by a tangent screw, which by a very slight movement causes
the aperture of the diaphragm to pass from the centre to the
periphery of the condenser. Altogether the arrangement of the
sub-stage is novel, and the instrument is extremely well arranged
and adapted to modern requirements.</p>

<p>Nachet and Hartnack, of Paris, hold an almost equal rank as
makers of first-class microscopes, and in point of excellence of
workmanship fairy rival those of our English makers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_98" src="images/fig_98.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 98.&mdash;Nachet’s Class Demonstrating Microscope.</p></div>

<p>There are very many other London and Continental makers of
microscopes besides those especially mentioned, who have well-sustained
reputations as opticians, and who, from want of space, I
have been obliged to pass over. Messrs. Newton’s Students’ Microscope
must be mentioned with respect. It is a good and useful
instrument, has a firm stand with a reversible (rotatory) body
movement, which seems to ensure steadiness when brought into
the horizontal position for micro-photographic purposes. There are
other opticians whose microscopes have stood the test of time&mdash;Messrs.
Collins, Crouch, &amp;c. It may, however, be taken as a
well-established fact that those opticians known to manufacture the
more highly-finished models also produce the more serviceable forms
of students’ class-room, and other microscopes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<h3>The Bacteriological Microscope.</h3>

<p>The microscope required for bacteriological studies should be
perfect in all its parts. With regard to the choice of an instrument,
it is very much a matter of price, since the most perfect is usually
the most costly; I shall therefore proceed to give a typical example
of the instrument in use in a bacteriological laboratory. The
microscope should possess the following qualifications, all of which
are absolutely necessary for the study of such minute objects as
bacteria and other micro-organisms.</p>

<p>“The typical bacteriological microscope should be well equipped
with objectives of sufficiently high magnifying power, and with a
special form of illuminating apparatus; while the mechanical
arrangements for focussing should act with the greatest smoothness
and precision; the stage, also, should be wide enough to admit of
the examination of plate cultivations.”</p>

<p>We will consider these several points and recommendations
<i>seriatim</i>, commencing with the stand.</p>

<p>Messrs. Watson &amp; Sons’ Van Heurck model stand so well answers
the several conditions laid down by an experienced teacher of
bacteriology, that I have no hesitation in presenting it to my readers
as a typical instrument, one in every way worthy of the high praise
it has already received from those who have worked with it, and
whose judgment may be relied upon in every way. The microscope is
fully described among Messrs. Watson’s instruments, page 108.</p>

<p><i>The Stand.</i>&mdash;A good firm stand is undoubtedly of the first
importance for all high-class work. The steadiness of the instrument
and its entire freedom from vibration depends largely upon the form
of the stand. I am glad to find Dr. Crookshank in accord with me
as to the Ross-Jackson model, one which, in my opinion, has not
been entirely superseded by models of a more recent date. Indeed,
the latest improvement effected in the Ross-Jackson form, in which
attention has been given to the spreading-out of the feet, has
converted it into as solid and firm a stand as Powell’s; it is equally
free from vibration when placed in the horizontal position.</p>

<p>There are, however, four different forms of stands&mdash;the tripod; the
plate with double columns; the single column ending in a plate or
a bent claw; and the horse shoe. The tripod stand, with cork feet,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
is by far the steadiest form of model. The single upright pillar
support should unquestionably be condemned, as it admits of
considerable vibration, and is most inconvenient for laboratory work.
The heavy horse-shoe form is compact and firm, and the weight of it
can hardly be considered an objection.</p>

<p><i>The Tubular Body</i> is from eight to ten inches in length, to which
is added a draw-tube with an engraved millimetre scale. By extending
the draw-tube greater magnification is obtained, but since this is at
the cost of definition it should hardly ever be employed in the
examination of bacteria. <i>A Triple Nose-piece</i> is doubtless a convenience,
saving time which is otherwise spent in replacing objectives
of different magnifying powers; there is also less risk of injuring them.
<i>Focus</i> should be obtained by means of a rack and pinion coarse
adjustment, together with the most approved kind of fine adjustment.
The sliding tube cannot be recommended, as the motion may be
stiff, encouraging the use of force, which in turn may result in the
objective being brought violently into contact with the specimen,
thus doing injury to the lens or damage to the preparation; or it
may get too loose and readily slip out of focus.</p>

<p><i>The Stage</i> should be flat and rigid, either rectangular or circular,
so long as it is sufficiently large to accommodate plate cultivation.
A removable mechanical stage is of great advantage for working with
high powers, as a motile bacterium can be constantly kept in view,
while one hand is engaged in working the fine adjustment; it may
also be employed as a finder, if engraved with a longitudinal and
vertical scale, and provided with a stop. The mechanical stage
must be removable, so that the stage proper may be free from any
attachments when required for the examination of cultures.</p>

<p><i>Diaphragms.</i>&mdash;The plan of using a series of separate discs of
different sizes should be avoided, as they are easily lost, and
bacteriological investigations may have to be made under conditions
in which it is difficult to replace them. A better plan is a revolving
plate with apertures of different sizes, but the most convenient form
is the <i>iris diaphragm</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Sub-stage Condenser</i> is as necessary in biological work as in the
objective&mdash;in fact, the condenser and the objective should be considered
as forming one piece of optical apparatus; the microscope
must be regarded as incomplete without it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p>It is by the <i>sub-stage condenser</i> that the rays of light are concentrated
at one point, or on one particular bacterium; for the
best definition it is essential that there should be mechanical
arrangements for accurately centring and focussing the condenser.
All this will be explained and enlarged upon under “Practical Optics.”</p>

<p>In the historical review presented to my readers on the evolution
of the modern microscope, I have for the most part relied upon my
long and close association, extending over a period of upwards of half
a century, with microscopy. I need hardly say I could have very
much extended my remarks with pleasure and profit had space
permitted, and thereby much increased the number of names
of manufacturers, who have well-established reputations for the
quality of their work, and whose instruments, more or less complete
in design, realise the wants of students and of that large class
of present-day workers engaged in microscopical pursuits to whom
economy of outlay is almost a first consideration. No valid reason,
however, can be assigned for splitting up, as some writers do, the
several forms of microscopes into some six different classes, which
implies inferiority in mechanical details or finish, whereas the difference
wholly consists in luxurious appliances to save time, and in
accessories for special work or original research. Before bringing
these remarks to a close, it is my wish to direct the student’s
attention to one or two points of importance in connection with
the use of the instrument, viz.: variations in body-lengths of microscopes,
especially between those of English and of Continental manufacture.
The <i>optical-standard</i> measurement adopted in this country
for the body-tube-length is 10 inches; and for its <i>mechanical</i>, 8&frac34; inches.
That of Continental opticians is, optical-tube-length 7·08 inches, or
180 mm.; the mechanical, 6·3 inches = to 168 mm.</p>

<p>Professor Abbe constructed an apochromatic immersion objective
especially for the English optical tube-length of 10·6 inches (= to
270 m.m.), and mechanical tube-length somewhat less in measurement.
This may be taken to mean a slight increase in the standard value
of the tube, and therefore the addition of the rack-and-pinion to the
draw-tube, now generally made a part of the microscope, is certainly
of some practical value. This difference, however, when working
with the English body-tube of 10 inches, may be discarded; it is,
in fact, only where the shorter Continental body is in use, that so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
small a difference of tube-length exercises a disturbing effect over
adjustment. Moreover, an object placed on the stage of the shorter
body microscope will not be seen with the same distinctness by the
draughtsman should he wish to make use of the <i>camera lucida</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>optical</i> tube-length of the body is measured from the back
lens of the objective to the front lens or principal focus of the eye-piece;
the <i>mechanical</i> tube-length from the end of nose-piece of
objective to the top lens of the eye-piece.</p>

<h3>Applied Optics:&mdash;Eye-pieces; Achromatic Objectives;
Condensers.</h3>

<p>It is almost unnecessary to say that the eye-piece forms a most
important part of applied optics in the microscope. It is an
optical combination designed to bring the pencil of rays from the
objective to assist in the formation of a real or virtual image before it
arrives at the eye of the observer. Greater attention has been given
of late years to the improvement of the eye-piece, since flatness of
field much depends upon it. Opticians have therefore sought to
make it both achromatic and compensatory.</p>

<p>There are several forms of eye-pieces in use, some of which partake
of a special character, and these will receive attention in their proper
places. It is, however, customary among English opticians to denote
the value of their several eye-pieces by Roman capitals, A, B, C, D,
and E. Continental opticians, on the other hand, have a preference
for numerals, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, or more, and by which they are
recognised.</p>

<p>The eye-piece in more general use is that known as the
<i>Huyghenian</i> (<a href="#fig_99">Fig. 99</a>); this came into use upwards of two centuries
ago. It was constructed by Christian Huyghens, a Dutch philosopher
and eminent man of science, secretary to William III.</p>

<p>It was made for the eye-piece of a telescope he constructed with
his own hands, and it has been in constant use as the eye-piece of
the microscope for nearly two centuries. It consists of two plano-convex
lenses, with their plane surfaces turned towards the eye, and
divided at a distance equal to half the sum of their focal lengths&mdash;in
other words, at half the sum of the focal length of the eye-glass
and of the distance from the field-glass at which an image from the
object glass would be formed, a stop, or diaphragm, being placed
between the two lenses for the reason about to be explained.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
Huyghens himself appears to have been quite unaware of the value
of an eye-piece so cleverly constructed.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_99" src="images/fig_99.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="hang">Fig. 99.&mdash;Huyghenian
Eye-piece A, the
dotted lines show
position of lenses.</p></div>

<p>It was reserved for Boscovich to point out that, by this important
arrangement, he had corrected a portion of the chromatic aberration
incidental to the earlier form of eye-pieces. Let <a href="#fig_100">Fig. 100</a> represent
the Huyghenian eye-piece of a microscope, <i>f f</i> being the field-glass,
and <i>e e</i> the eye-glass, and <i>l m n</i> the two extreme rays of each of the
three pencils emanating from the centre and ends of the object, of
which, but for the field-glass, a series of coloured images would be
formed from <i>r r</i> to <i>b b</i>; those near <i>r r</i> being
red, those near <i>b b</i> blue, and the intermediate
ones green, yellow, and so on, corresponding
with the colours of the prismatic Spectrum.</p>

<p>The effect described, that of projecting the
blue image beyond the red, over-correcting the
object-glass as to colour, is purposely produced;
it is also seen that the images <i>b b</i> and <i>r r</i> are
curved in the wrong direction to be seen distinctly
by the convex eye-lens; this then is
a further defect of the compound microscope
made up of two lenses. But the field-glass, at
the same time that it bends the rays and converges
them to foci at <i>b′ b′</i> and <i>r′ r′</i>, also
reverses the curvature of the images as here
shown, giving them the form best adapted for
distinct vision by the eye-glass <i>e e</i>. The field-glass
has at the same time brought the blue and red images closer
together, so that they produce an almost colourless image to the eye.
The chromatic aberration of lenses has been clearly explained in a
previous chapter. But let it be supposed that the object-glass had
not been over-corrected, that it had been perfectly achromatic; the
rays would then have appeared coloured as soon as they had passed
the field-glass; the blue rays of the central pencil, for example,
would converge at <i>b′′</i>, and the red rays at <i>r′′</i>, which is just the
reverse of what is required of the eye-lens; for as its blue focus is
also shorter than its red, it would require that the blue image should
be at <i>r′′</i>, and the red at <i>b′′</i>. This effect is due to over-correction of
the object-glass, which removes the blue foci <i>b b</i> as much beyond
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
the red foci <i>r r</i> as the sum of the distances between the red and the
blue foci of the field-lens and eye-lens; so that the separation <i>b r</i> is
exactly taken up in passing through those two lenses, and the several
colours coincide, so far as focal distance is concerned, as the rays pass
the eye-lens. So that while they coincide as to distance, they differ in
another respect&mdash;the blue image is rendered smaller than the red
by the greater refractive power of the field-glass upon the former.
In tracing the pencil <i>l</i>, for instance, it will be noticed that, after
passing the field-glass, two sets of lines are drawn, one whole and one
dotted, the former representing the red, and the latter the blue rays.
This accidental effect in the Huyghenian eye-piece was pointed out
by Boscovich. The separation into colours of the field-glass is like
the over-correction of the object-glass&mdash;and opens the way to its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
complete correction. If the differently-coloured rays were kept
together till they reached the eye-glass, they would still be coloured,
and present coloured images to the eye. The separating effected
by the field-glass causes the blue rays to fall so much nearer the
centre of the eye-glass, where, owing to its spherical figure, the
refractive power is less than at the margin, so that spherical error
of the eye-lens may be said to constitute a nearly equal balance to
the chromatic dispersion of the field-lens, and the blue and red rays
<i>l′</i> and <i>l′′</i> emerge nearly parallel, presenting a fairly good definition
of a single point to the eye. The same may be said of the intermediate
colours of the other pencils. The eye-glass thus constructed
not only brings together the images <i>b′ b′</i>, <i>r′ r′</i>, but it likewise has
the most important effect of rendering them flatter, and assisting in
the correction of chromatic and spherical aberration.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_101" src="images/fig_101.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 101.&mdash;Ramsden’s Eye-piece.</p></div>

<p>The later form of the Huyghenian eye-piece is that of the late
Sir George Airy, the field-glass of which is a meniscus with the convex
side turned towards the objective, and the eye-lens a crossed convex
with its flatter side towards the eye. Another negative eye-piece is
that known as the <i>Kellner</i>, or orthoscopic eye-piece. It consists of
a bi-convex field-glass and an achromatic doublet eye-lens. This
magnifies ten times, but it in no way compares with the Huyghenian
in value. Neither does it afford the same flatness of field.</p>

<p>The <i>Ramsden</i>, or positive eye-piece, is chiefly employed as a micrometer
eye-piece for the measurement of the values of magnified
images. The construction of this eye-piece is shown in <a href="#fig_101">Fig. 101</a>, a
divided scale being cut on a strip of glass in <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub>ths of an inch, every
fifth of which is cut longer than the rest to facilitate the reading
of the markings, and at the same time that of the image of the
object, both being distinctly seen together, as in the accompanying
reduced micro-photograph of blood corpuscles, <a href="#fig_102">Fig. 102</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>The value of such measurements in reference to the real object,
when once obtained; is constant for the same objective. It becomes
apparent, then, that the value of the divisions seen in the eye-piece
micrometer must be found with all the objectives used, and carefully
tabulated.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Lister who first proposed to place on the stage of the
microscope a divided scale of a certain value. Viewing the scale as a
microscopic object, he observed how many of the divisions on the
scale attached to the eye-piece corresponded with one or more of a
magnified image. If, for instance, ten of those in the eye-piece
correspond with one of those in the image, and if the divisions are
known to be equal, then the
image is ten times larger than
the object, and the dimensions
of the object ten times less than
that indicated by the micrometer.
If the divisions on the
micrometer and on the magnified
scale are not equal, it becomes
a mere rule-of-three sum; but
in general this trouble is taken
by the maker of the instrument,
who furnishes a table showing
the value of each division of the micrometer for every object-glass
with which it will be employed.</p>

<div class="figright">

<p class="caption">Fig. 102.&mdash;Blood Corpuscles and Micrometer,

<p>Mr. Jackson’s simple and cheap micrometer is represented in
<a href="#fig_103">Fig. 103</a>. It consists of a slip of glass placed in the focus of the
eye-glass, with the divisions sufficiently fine to have the value of
the ten-thousandth part of an inch with the quarter-inch object-glass,
and the twenty-thousandth with the eighth; at the same time the half,
or even the quarter of a division may be estimated, thus affording
the means of attaining considerable accuracy, and may be used to
supersede the more complicated and expensive screw-micrometer,
being handier to use, and not liable to derangement in inexperienced
hands.</p>

<p>The positive eye-piece affords the best view of the micrometer, the
negative of the object. The former is quite free from distortion,
even to the edges of the field; but the object is slightly coloured.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
The latter is free from colour, and is slightly distorted at the edges.
In the centre of the field, however, to the extent of half its diameter,
there is no perceptible distortion, and the clearness of the definition
gives a precision to the measurement which is very satisfactory.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_103" src="images/fig_103.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 103.&mdash;Jackson’s Eye-piece Micrometer.</p></div>

<p>Short bold lines are ruled on a piece of glass, <i>a</i>, <a href="#fig_103">Fig. 103</a>, to facilitate
counting, the fifth is drawn longer, and the tenth still longer, as
in the common rule. Very fine levigated plumbago is rubbed into
the lines to render them visible; they are then covered with a piece
of thin glass, cemented by Canada balsam, to prevent the plumbago
from being wiped out. The slip of glass thus prepared is secured in
a thin brass frame, so that it
may slide freely into its place.</p>

<p>Slips are cut in the negative
eye-piece on each side, so that
the brass frame may be pressed
across the field in the focus of
the eye-glass, as at <i>m</i>; the cell
of which should have a longer
screw than usual, to admit of
adjustment for different eyes.
The brass frame is retained in
its place by a spring within
the tube of the eye-piece; and
in using it the object is brought
to the centre of the field by the
stage movements; the coincidence
between one side of it and one of the long lines is made
with great accuracy by means of the small screw acting upon the
slip of glass. The divisions are then read off as easily as the inches
and tenths on a common rule. The operation, indeed, is nothing
more than the laying of a rule across the body to be measured; and
it matters not whether the object be transparent or opaque, mounted
or unmounted, if its edges can be distinctly seen, its diameter can
be taken.</p>

<p>Previously, however, to using the micrometer, the value of its
divisions should be ascertained with each object-glass; the method of
doing this is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Place a slip of ruled glass on the stage; and having turned the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
eye-piece so that the lines on the two glasses are parallel, read off
the number of divisions in the eye-piece which cover one on the stage.
Repeat this process with different portions of the stage-micrometer,
and if there be a difference, take the mean. Suppose the hundredth
of an inch on the stage requires eighteen divisions in the eye-piece to
cover it; it is plain that an inch would require eighteen hundred,
and an object which occupied nine of these divisions would measure
the two-hundredth of an inch. Take the instance supposed, and let
the microscope be furnished with a draw-tube, marked on the side
with inches and tenths. By drawing this out a short distance, the
image of the stage micrometer will be expanded until one division is
covered by twenty in the eye-piece. These will then have the value
of two-thousandths of an inch, and the object which before measured
nine will then measure ten; which, divided by 2,000, gives the
decimal fraction ·005.</p>

<p>Enter in a table the length to which the tube is drawn out, and
the number of divisions on the eye-piece micrometer equivalent to
an inch on the stage; and any measurements afterwards taken with
the same micrometer and object-glass may, by a short process of
mental arithmetic, be reduced to the decimal parts of an inch, if not
actually observed in them.</p>

<p>In ascertaining the value of the micrometer with a deep objective,
if the hundredth of an inch on the stage occupies too much of the
field, then the two-hundredth or five-hundredth should be used and
the number of the divisions corresponding to that quantity be
multiplied by two hundred or five hundred, as the case may be.</p>

<p>The micrometer should not be fitted into too deep an eye-piece, as
it is essential to preserve good definition. A middle-power Kellner
or Huyghenian is frequently employed; at all events, use the eye-piece
of lower power rather than impair the image.</p>

<p>The eye-lens above the micrometer should not be of shorter focus
than three-quarters of an inch, even with high-power objectives.</p>

<p><i>The Ramsden Eye-piece.</i>&mdash;The cobweb micrometer is the most
efficient piece of apparatus yet brought into use for measuring the
magnified image. It is made by stretching across the field of the
eye-piece two extremely fine parallel wires or cobwebs, one or both of
which can be separated by the action of a micrometer screw, the trap
head of which is divided into a hundred or more equal parts, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
successively pass by an index as the milled head is turned, shown
in <a href="#fig_104">Fig. 104</a>. A portion of the field of view is cut off at right
angles to the filaments by a scale formed of a thin plate of brass
having notches at its edges, the distances between which correspond
to the threads of the screw, every fifth notch (as in the previous case)
being made deeper than the rest, to make the work of enumeration
easier. The number of entire divisions on the scale shows then
how many complete turns of the screw have been made in the
separation of the wires, while the number of index points on the
milled head shows the value to the fraction of a turn, that may have
been made in addition. A screw with one hundred threads to the
inch is that usually employed; this gives to each division in the
scale in the eye-piece the value of <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub>th of an inch. The edge of the
milled head is also divided into the same number of parts.</p>

<p>In Watson’s Ramsden screw micrometer, <a href="#fig_104">Fig. 104</a>, the micrometer
scale (seen detached) is ruled on a circular piece of glass, and this,
by unscrewing the top, is dropped into its place, and one of the
wires, both being fixed, is set a little to the side of the field, the
teeth of the screw being cut to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub>ths, and the drum giving the
fractional space between the teeth to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub>ths, so that the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10000</sub>th of
an inch can be read off. This micrometer eye-piece is constructed
entirely of aluminium, a decided advantage, being so much lighter
than brass to handle.</p>

<p>In the screw micrometer of other makers, other modifications are
found. An iris diaphragm being placed below the web to suit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
the power of the eye-piece employed, a guiding line at right angles
to the web is sometimes added. Care should be taken to see that
when the movable web coincides exactly with the fixed web, the
indicator on the graduated head stands at zero.</p>

<p><i>The Compensating Eye-piece.</i>&mdash;The very important improvements
effected in the construction of the objective naturally led up to an
equally useful change for the better in the eye-piece.</p>

<p>All objectives of wide aperture, from the curvature of their
hemispherical front lenses, show a certain amount of colour defect
in the extra-axial portion of the field, even if perfectly achromatic
in the centre. Whether an image be directly projected by the
objective, or whether it be examined with an aplanatic eye-piece,
colour fringes may be detected, possibly in an increasing degree
towards the periphery. This residual chromatic aberration has at
length been very nearly eliminated by the aid of the compensating
eye-piece.</p>

<p>The construction of compensating eye-pieces is somewhat remarkable,
since they have an equivalent error in an opposite direction&mdash;that
is, the image formed by the red rays is greater than that
corresponding to the blue rays; consequently, eye-pieces so constructed
serve to compensate for the unequal magnification produced
by different coloured rays, and images appear free from colour up to
the margin of the field.</p>

<p>Zeiss’s compensating eye-pieces are so arranged that the lower
focal points of each series lie in the same plane when inserted in
the body-tube of the microscope; no alteration of focus is therefore
required on changing one eye-piece for another. This of itself is not
only an advantage but also a saving of time, while the distance
between the upper focal point of the objective and the lower one
of the eye-piece, which is the determining element of magnification,
remains constant.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_105" src="images/fig_105.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 105.&mdash;A sectional view of Zeiss’s Compensating series of Eye-pieces,

<p class="hang">B.&mdash;Lower focal plane of eye-pieces, with their lenses
<i>in situ</i>.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>The ordinary working eye-pieces, Huyghenian and others, commencing
with a magnification of four diameters, are so constructed
that they can be conveniently used, as we are accustomed to use them
in England, with high powers, Zeiss’s Nos. 12 and 18 compensating
eye-pieces being adapted for use with his lower power apochromatic
lenses of 16 and 8 mm. The numbering of the eye-pieces is carried
out on the plan originally proposed by Professor Abbe&mdash;that is, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
number denotes how many times an eye-piece, when employed with
a given tube-length, increases the initial magnifying power of the
objective, and at the same time furnishes figures for their rational
enumeration. It is on this basis that the German compensating
eye-pieces have been arranged in series, and in agreement with their
magnifying power and distinctive numberings of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18.
Of these several eye-pieces, 12 is found to be the most useful. The
magnification obtained by combining a compensating eye-piece with
any apochromatic objective is found by multiplying its number by
the initial magnification of the objective, as given in the following
proof:&mdash;An objective of 3·0 mm. focus, for example, gives in itself a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
magnification of 83·3 (calculated, for the conventional distance of
vision, 250 mm.); eye-piece 12 therefore gives with this objective
a magnification of 12 &times; 83·3 = 1000 diameters. The classification,
however, of these eye-pieces, as furnished by Abbe, is dependent upon
increase in the total magnifying power of the microscope obtained
by means of the eye-piece as compared with that given by the
objective alone. The numbering, then, denotes how many times an
eye-piece increases the magnifying power of the objective when used
with a given body-tube; the proper measure of the eye-piece magnification;
and, at the same time, the figures for rational enumeration.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_106" src="images/fig_106.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 106.&mdash;B and C Achromatic Eye-pieces.</p></div>

<p>Compensating eye-pieces have been introduced for the correction
of certain errors in high-power objectives&mdash;those made with hemispherical
fronts. All such lenses, whether apochromatic or not,
are greatly improved by the compensating eye-piece, but the dry
objective and the lower powers are certainly deteriorated. The
lower power compensating eye-pieces are Huyghenian, the higher are
combinations, with no field-lens, and therefore in working act as
a single or positive eye-piece. This is of importance to those who
work with low powers&mdash;the older forms of objectives.</p>

<p>Messrs. Watson and Swift have adopted a new formula for their
series of <i>achromatic eye-pieces</i>, whereby their magnification and
flatness of field are improved. These also bear a constant ratio to
the initial power of their objectives.</p>

<p>The compensating eye-pieces of these makers are constructed on
the same principle as those of Zeiss’s for the correction of errors of
colour in the marginal portion of the field, and consequently are in every
way as effective as those of Continental manufacture. Figs. 106, 107,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
and 108 show in dotted outline the form and position of the several
lenses combined in these eye-pieces.</p>

<p><i>Projection Eye-pieces</i> are chiefly used in micro-photography, and
for screen demonstrations. The cap of this eye-piece is provided
with a spiral adjustment for focussing, the diaphragm being placed in
front of the eye-lens, an essential arrangement for obtaining an
accurate focus. The ring seen below the cap, <a href="#fig_108">Fig. 108</a>, is graduated
so that the rotation for distance of screen may be carefully recorded.</p>

<p>Schmidt’s goniometer positive eye-piece, for measuring the angles
of crystals, is so arranged as to be easily rotated within a large and
accurately graduated circle. In the focus of the eye-piece a single
cobweb is drawn across, and to the upper part is attached a vernier.
The crystals being placed in the field of the microscope, care being
taken that they lie <i>perfectly flat</i>, the vernier is brought to zero, and
then the whole apparatus turned until the line is parallel with one
face of the crystal; the frame-work bearing the cobweb, with the
vernier, is now rotated until the cobweb becomes parallel with the
next face of the crystal, and the number of degrees which it has
traversed may then be accurately read off.</p>

<p><i>Goniometer.</i>&mdash;If a higher degree of precision is required, then,
the double-refracting goniometer invented by the late Dr. Leeson
must be substituted. With this goniometer (<a href="#fig_109">Fig. 109</a>) the angles
of crystals, whether microscopic or otherwise, can be measured. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
has removed the earlier difficulties incident to similar instruments
formerly in use. Among other advantages, it is capable of measuring
opaque and even imperfect crystals, beside microscopic crystals and
those in the interior of other transparent media. It is equally
applicable to the largest crystals, and will measure angles without
removing the crystal from a specimen, provided only the whole is
placed on a suitable adjusting stage. The value of the goniometer
depends on the application of a doubly refracting prism, either of
Iceland spar or of quartz, cut of such a thickness as will partially
separate the two images of the angle it is proposed to measure.</p>

<p>Dr. Leeson strongly insisted on the importance of the microscope
in the examination of the planes of crystals subjected to measurement,
as obliquity in many cases
arises from not only conchoidal
fractures, but also from imperfect
lamin&aelig; elevating one portion
of a plane, and yet allowing
a very tolerable reflection when
measured by the double refracting
goniometer.</p>

<div class="figright">

<p class="caption">Fig. 109.&mdash;Leeson’s Goniometer.</p></div>

<p>Microscopes for crystallographic
and petrological research are now specially constructed for
measuring the angles of crystals.</p>

<p>Erector eye-pieces and erecting prisms are employed for the
purpose of causing the image presented to the eye to correspond
with that of the object. They are also helpful in making minute
dissections of structure; the loss of light, however, by sending it
through two additional surfaces is a drawback, and impairs the
sharpness of the image. Nachet designed an extremely ingenious
arrangement whereby the inverted image became erect; he adapted
a simple rectangular prism to the eye-piece. The obliquity which
a prism gives to the visual rays when the microscope is used
in the erect position, as for dissecting, is an advantage, as it
brings the image to the eye at an angle very nearly corresponding
to that of the inclined position in which the microscope
is ordinarily used.

<h3>The Achromatic Objective.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_110" src="images/fig_110.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 110.&mdash;Pan-aplanatic Achromatic Objectives.</p></div>

<p><i>The Achromatic Objective</i>, of all the optical and mechanical
adjuncts to the microscope, is in every way the most necessary,
as well as the most important. The ideal of perfection aimed at
by the optician is a combination of lenses that shall produce a
perfect image&mdash;that is, one absolutely perfect in definition and
almost free from colour. The method resorted to for the elimination
of spherical and chromatic aberration in the lens has been
fully explained in a former chapter. It will now be my endeavour
to show the progressive stages of achromatism and evolution of the
microscope throughout the present century.</p>

<p>It is almost as difficult to assign the date of the earliest application
of achromatism to the microscope as to that of the inception
and many modifications of the instrument in past ages; indeed, the
question of priority in every step taken in its improvement has
been the subject of controversy.</p>

<p>Among the earlier workers in the first decade of this century
will be found the name of Bernardo Marzoni, who was curator of
the Physical Laboratory of the Lyceum of Brescia. He, an amateur
optician, it has come to light, in 1808 constructed an achromatic
objective, and exhibited it at Milan in 1811, when he obtained the
award of a silver medal for its merits, under the authority of the
“Institute Reale delli Scienzo.” Through the good offices of the
late Mr. John Mayall one of Marzoni’s objectives, which had been
carefully preserved, was presented to the Royal Microscopical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
Society of London in 1890.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> This objective is a cemented combination,
with the plane side of the flint-lens presented to the
object. This was an improvement of a practical kind, and of which
Chevalier subsequently availed himself. In 1823 Selligue, a French
optician, is credited with having first suggested the plan of combining
two, three, or four plano-convex achromatic doublets of similar foci,
one above the other, to increase the power and the aperture of the
microscope. Fresnel, who reported upon this invention, preferred on
the whole Adam’s arrangement, because it gave a larger field.
Selligue subsequently improved his objective by placing a small
diaphragm between the mirror and the object.</p>

<p>In this country, Tully was induced by Dr. Goring to work at the
achromatic objective, and his first efforts were attended with a success
quite equal to that of Chevalier’s. Lister on examining these lenses
said:&mdash;“The French optician knows nothing of the value of
aperture, but he has shown us that fine performance is not confined
to triple objectives.” Amici, the amateur optician of Modena, visited
this country in 1827 and brought his achromatic microscope and
objectives, which were seen to give increase of aperture by combining
doublets with triplets. The most lasting improvement in the
achromatic objective was that of Joseph Jackson Lister, F.R.S.,
the father of Lord Lister, and one of the founders of the Royal
Microscopical Society of London.</p>

<p>Lister’s discoveries at this period (1829) in the history of the
optics of the microscope were of greater importance than they have
been represented to be. That he was an enthusiast is manifest, for,
being unable to find an optician to carry out his formula for grinding
lenses, he at once set to work to grind his own, and in a short time
was able to make a lens which was said to be the best of the day.</p>

<p>Lister, in a paper contributed to the proceedings of the Royal
Society the same year, pointed out how the aberrations of one
doublet could be neutralised by a second. He further demonstrated
that the flint lens should be a plano-concave joined by a permanent
cement to the convex crown-glass. The first condition, he states,
“obviates the risk of error in centring the two curves, and the
second diminishes by one half the loss of light from reflection, which
is very great at the numerous surfaces of every combination.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
These two conditions then&mdash;that the flint lens shall be plano-concave,
and that it shall be joined by some cement (Canada balsam) to the
convex&mdash;may be taken as the basis for the microscopic objective,
provided they can be reconciled with the correction of spherical and
chromatic aberration of a large pencil.</p>

<p>Andrew Ross was not slow to perceive the value of Lister’s
suggestions and in 1831 he had constructed an object-glass on the
lines laid down by Lister, <a href="#fig_112">Fig. 112</a>; <i>a a′</i> representing the anterior
pair, <i>m</i> the middle, and <i>p</i> the posterior, the three sets combined
forming the achromatic objective, consisting of three pairs of lenses,
a double-convex crown-glass, and a plano-concave of flint.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 112.&mdash;Andrew Ross’s

<p>Lister proposed other combinations, and himself made an
object-glass consisting of a meniscus pair with a triple middle,
and a back plano-convex doublet. This had a working distance of ·11
and proved to be so great a success that other opticians&mdash;Hugh
Powell, 1834; James Smith, 1839&mdash;made objectives after the same
formula.</p>

<p>The publication of Lister’s data proved of value in another
direction: it stimulated opticians to apply themselves to the further
improvement of the achromatic objective. Andrew Ross was one
of the more earnest workers in giving effect to Lister’s principles
and a short time afterwards found that a triple combination, with
the lenses separated by short intervals, gave better results. In
the accompanying diagram the changes made in the combination of
the objective from 1831, and extending over a period of about
twenty years from this date, are shown.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

<p>Each objective, from the &frac12;-inch to the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch, is seen to be built
up of at least six or eight different fronts, the back combinations
being a triplet formed of two double-convex lenses of crown glass
with an intermediary double concave lens of flint-glass.</p>

<p>No sooner had Ross constructed &frac14;-inch achromatic objectives on
Lister’s formula than he discovered
an error which had hitherto
escaped attention, viz., that the
thinnest cover-glass of an object
produced a considerable amount of
refractive disturbance. A marked
difference was observed in the
image when viewed with or without
a cover-glass. This difficulty
was first met by the addition of a
draw-tube to the microscope body.
But as this also impaired the
image, Lister overcame the difficulty
by mounting the front lens
of the objective in a separate tube made to fit over a second tube
carrying the two pairs of lenses. This arrangement led up to his invention
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
of the <i>screw-collar adjustment</i>, the mechanism for applying which
is shown in <a href="#fig_114">Fig. 114</a>. The anterior lens <i>a</i> at the end of the tube is
enclosed in a brass-piece <i>b</i> containing the combination; the tube <i>a</i>,
holding the lens nearest the object, is then made to move up or down
the cylinder <i>b</i>, thus varying the distance, according to the thickness of
the glass covering the object, by turning the screw ring <i>c</i>, thus
causing the one tube to slide over the other, and clamping them
together when properly adjusted. An aperture is made in the tube
<i>a</i>, within which is seen a mark engraved on the cylinder, on the
edge of which are two marks, a longer and a shorter, engraved upon
the tube. When the mark on the cylinder coincides with the
longer mark on the tube, the adjustment is
made for an uncovered object; and when the
coincidence is with the shorter mark, the proper
distance is obtained to balance the aberrations
produced by a cover-glass the hundredth
of an inch thick; such glass covers are now
supplied. The adjustment should be tested
experimentally by moving the milled edge
which separates or closes the combinations,
and at the same time using the fine adjusting
screw of the microscope. The difficulty
associated with the cover-glass of old has,
by the introduction of the homogeneous
immersion system, been very nearly eliminated.
There still remains, however, a disturbing amount of residual
colour aberration in the achromatic dry objective, and for the
correction of which Zeiss proposed mounting the several lenses
on a method somewhat different to that so long in use in this
country. <a href="#fig_115">Fig. 115</a> shows an objective in which the screw-collar
ring <i>b b</i> is made to adjust the exact distance between the two back
lenses placed at <i>a a</i>. The value of the screw-collar is not questioned.
It is difficult to obtain at all times cover-glasses of a perfectly uniform
thickness; they will vary, and therefore perfect definition must be
obtained, as heretofore, by adjusting for each separate preparation
while the object is under examination.</p>

<p>As early as 1842 the excellence of Andrew Ross’s achromatic
objectives were acknowledged, and his formula for their construction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
was generally followed. No doubt many of these early objectives of
his manufacture are still regarded as treasures. I possess a &frac12;-inch
and a &frac14;-inch, which I believe to be comparable with any achromatic
objectives of the same apertures of the present day. These I have
always found most serviceable for histological work.</p>

<p>In 1850 Mr. Wenham produced an achromatic objective of considerable
achromatic value. This consisted of a single hemispherical
front combination, shown in the accompanying enlarged diagram,
<a href="#fig_116">Fig. 116</a>. Wenham’s formula seems to have been generally adopted
by Continental opticians, who sold these lenses at a reduction of
price. In Paris, Prazmowski and Hartnack&mdash;I have had one of
Hartnack’s earliest immersions in use for many
years&mdash;brought this form of objective to greater
perfection, and in 1867 Powell and Lealand
adopted the single front combination system in
their early water-immersion objective, whereby
the focal distance was said to be “practically
a constant quantity, while reduction of aperture
by making the front lens thinner ensures a
much greater working distance without affecting
the aberrations, since the first refraction takes
place at the posterior or curved surface of the
front lens, the removal of any portion of thickness
at the anterior or plane surface simply cuts
off zones of peripheral rays without altering the
distance&mdash;any space being filled by the homogeneous immersion
fluid, or by an extra thickness of cover-glass.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>Great improvements were brought about by R. B. Tolles, of
Boston, 1874, in the objective, as well as in the optical and
mechanical parts of the microscope, most of which, however, must
be ascribed to the criticisms and suggestions of amateur workers
skilled in the exhibition of test-objects&mdash;the late Dr. Woodward of
Washington, for example, whose series of photographs of the more
difficult frustules of diatoms have rarely been surpassed. Such
results were due to improvements made in the optical part of the
microscope at his suggestion. He came to the conclusion, arrived at
about the same time by mathematical scientists, that increase of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
power in the microscope was only possible in two directions, the
qualitative and the quantitative.</p>

<p>It was now that microscopists turned to the late Professor Abbe
for assistance in perfecting the objective in the dioptric direction.
This, he pointed out, must be looked for in further improvements in
the art of glass-making.</p>

<p>A series of experiments ultimately brought to light a mineral
substance, <i>Fluorite</i>, which, when combined in the proper proportion,
one part to two of German crown and flint glass, was found to have
the qualities looked for, and to possess different relations of a dispersive
and refractive power. From Professor Abbe’s researches, begun
in 1876, we have had the aperture of the objective greatly enlarged,
and the homogeneous system brought into general use.</p>

<p>Previous to this date the best made objective merely approximated
to colour correction. Undoubtedly the chief object to be
obtained was the removal or diminution of the secondary colour
aberration. This, together with other residual errors Abbe pointed
out in 1880, led to the improvement of the optical quality of the
glass used in the manufacture of all optical instruments, the chief
difficulties being surmounted in the Jena glass factory, whereby
a complete revolution was effected in the microscopic objective.
The apochromatic glasses of Zeiss, Powell, Beck, Ross,
Watson, Swift, and other makers, in which the secondary spectrum
has been totally eliminated, or only a negligible tertiary spectrum
remains&mdash;that is to say, the objectives of these makers&mdash;are now
corrected for three spectrum rays, and not two, as in the older
objectives; and only those who look forward for making further
discoveries in the intimate structure of bacilli or for resolving
the finest diatom markings can be said to fully appreciate the
importance and value of the investigations of the late Professor
Abbe, and which have, so to speak, entirely changed old empirical
views as to the value of high aperture, and demonstrated that high
amplification, unless associated by proportionally high aperture,
necessarily produces untrue images of minute structures. It was he
also who introduced a practically perfect system of estimating
apertures, known as the “numerical aperture notation,” by which
not only can an accurate comparison be made of the relative
apertures of any series of objectives, whether dry or immersion, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
their resolving power under the various conditions of the kind of
light employed. Their penetrating power and their illuminating
power can now be estimated with mathematical exactness.</p>

of an Apochromatic
Combination.</p></div>

<p>The practical advantages, then, secured by the adoption of the
homogeneous system were, on the whole, greater than any before
made or believed to be possible, and when
taken into account in connection with the
improvement of the eye-piece (also due to
Abbe), almost perfect achromatism and homogeneity
between objective, object, and eye-piece
is secured, together with a sharp definition of
the image over the whole visual field. These,
with an increase of working distance between
the object and the objective, and other important
results, have been placed within the reach of the
microscopist by men of science, and the outcome
is the general adoption of the homogeneous
system, termed by Carl Zeiss, a fellow-worker with Abbe, the<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
apochromatic system of constructing objectives.</p>

<h3>Relative Merits of the English and German Objectives.</h3>

<p>As to the relative merits of German-made objectives, no superiority
can be claimed for them over those made by English opticians.</p>

<p>The Continental form of the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch oil-immersion objective, shown
in <a href="#fig_118">Fig. 118</a>, on the scale of 6 to 1, consists of four systems of lenses,
namely, the front, a deep hemispherical crown lens of high refractive
index; the second front of the system, an achromatic lens of such a
form that it gathers the light from the hemispherical front; the
middle lens, a single meniscus; and the back an achromatised lens,
the second front of the back being connected in such a way as to
compensate for the spherical and chromatic aberrations of the front
lens.</p>

<p>The first homogeneous immersion objective which came under my
observation was manufactured in the well-known Jena workshop of
Carl Zeiss, December, 1877. This had a very considerable increase
of <i>numerical aperture</i>, upwards of 50 per cent.; a clear gain, as an oil
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
angle of even 110&deg; proved to be of greater value than an angle
of 180&deg; in air, while the resolving power of the objective was
increased in like proportion. There does not at present appear
to be a bar to the construction of objectives of yet higher power,
with increase of aperture. The available course open in this direction
is the further discovery of another vitreous material and a suitable
immersion fluid with an index of 1·8 or 1·9, and glass with a
corresponding index, so as to ensure homogeneity of the combination.
Zeiss asserts that in the more difficult departments of microscopical
research the apochromatic lenses will supplant the older objectives,
yet there are many problems in
microscopy awaiting solution which
do not demand the highest attainable
degree of perfection in the objective,
and in the majority of cases the older
achromatic objective is all that is needful,
provided it is good of its kind.
The achromatic objectives and eye-pieces
of the older type have still an
advantage, as, owing to their simpler
construction, really good lenses of the
class required can be purchased at
considerably lower prices than the
objectives of the new series. These,
from being more complicated in construction, involve a greater
amount of skilled manual labour.</p>

<p class="hang">Fig. 118.&mdash;The Continental <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-in.
Oil-immersion Combination
(enlarged diagram).</p></div>

<p>The German glasses of to-day afford satisfactory evidence both of
skill and workmanship displayed in their production. Their cost is
greater, then, for the reason given, as will be seen on reference to
Continental catalogues. The dry series of objectives cost somewhat
less, a &frac12;-inch (numerical aperture 0·30) can be had for &pound;1 10s.,
and a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub>-inch (numerical aperture 0·65) for &pound;2. On the other hand,
the apochromatic series rapidly increase in price as the numerical
aperture approaches the limit of numerical aperture 0·40. The
best of Zeiss’s series are the 12 mm. (&frac12;-inch) and the 3 mm.
(<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>-inch), numerical aperture 1·4, both of which possess the optical
capacity assigned to them. These objectives are undoubtedly the
finest to be met with in the workshop of any optician. Achromatic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
objectives of Continental manufacture have been as much improved
as those of English make by the introduction of the newer varieties
of glass, as already explained, while a new nomenclature has sprung
up in consequence. We now have semi-apochromatic and parachromatic.
The German opticians have followed Zeiss’s lead, since almost
the same series of objectives are given in the catalogues of Leitz,
Reichert, and Seibert, while the quality of both dry and immersion
objectives is found to be much the same. The low price of
Reichert’s immersion objectives should be noted, as their performance
is quite perfect. A <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch (numerical aperture 1·30) of Leitz’s, with
which I have worked at <i>bacteria</i>, has given me much satisfaction;
supplied by Watson and Baker at &pound;5. A <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch dry objective by
the same maker (numerical aperture 0·87) costs &pound;3, and a water
immersion <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch (numerical aperture 1·10) &pound;3 5s. Leitz reminds
me that it requires a good lens of from six to seven hundred
magnifying power for the examination of bacteria. For this reason
he has constructed a new form of lens, a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>-inch oil-immersion of 2·5
mm. focus, for the purpose of adding to the resources of bacteriology.
This lens necessarily has a lower magnification than his former <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch
oil-lens, but as it is less costly to manufacture it is sold at a smaller
price. The before-mentioned <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch, with a No. 3 compensating eye-piece,
gives a magnification of over seven hundred or eight hundred
diameters. To secure the best results in using the higher powers of
Leitz’s, from No. 5 upwards, a cover-glass of 0·17 mm. in thickness
should be used, and care taken to make the length of the draw-tube
equal to 170 mm. This length of tube should be adhered to
in the use of this optician’s oil-immersion lenses. If the microscope
be provided with a nose-piece, the draw-tube should be drawn out to
160 mm.; in its absence it should be set at 170 mm., a deviation
of 10 mm. or more from the correct tube-length deteriorates from the
value of Leitz’s oil-immersion objectives as of other opticians. It
is suggested that the German apochromatic combination of three
cemented lenses is that adopted by Steinheil long before, in the
construction of his well-known hand-magnifier (see page 77, <a href="#fig_51">Fig. 51</a>).
Zeiss’s 3 mm. objective has a triple front, balanced by two triple
backs&mdash;in all nine lenses&mdash;a somewhat amplified diagram of which is
represented in <a href="#fig_118">Fig. 118</a>. The formula for this combination was
furnished by Tolles, of Boston, America, and it at once secured increase
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
of aperture (the value of this optician’s many contributions to
microscopy has since his death been generally acknowledged). The
metrical equivalent focus assigned by Zeiss to his series of dry
achromatic objectives is given in somewhat ambiguous terms, which
tend to confuse rather than classify them; for instance, two lenses
of the same aperture&mdash;24 mm. and 16 mm.&mdash;corresponding to the
English 1-inch and <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>-inch, each have assigned to them an aperture
of 0·30; a 12 mm. and 8 mm., corresponding to the English &frac12;-inch
and <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>-inch, have an aperture of 0·65; while a 6 mm. = &frac14;-inch, and
a 4 mm. = &frac14;-inch and <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub>-inch, have each an aperture of 0·95.</p>

<p>Nachet exhibited at the Antwerp Exhibition a fine <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>-inch oil-immersion,
which was highly praised by the jurors.</p>

<p>It is necessary, to make the fact perfectly clear, that dry and
immersion lenses having the same angular aperture have also a similar
defining power. The pencil of rays, however, differs in intensity and
density as the rays emerging from the cover-glass of the object into
air are very considerably deflected, and the cone suffers a corresponding
loss of brightness. On this important point, then, I believe it will
prove of value to interpolate a clear and full exposition of the change
brought about by the cover-glass.</p>

<p>It is not difficult, then, to perceive the importance of Amici’s discovery
as to the value of a drop of water inserted between the object
and the objective, and it now seems somewhat surprising it should have
been so long neglected by opticians, since it is at once seen to diminish
the reflection which takes place in the incidence of oblique light.
The film of water not only gives increased aperture, but also greater
cleanness and sharpness to the image. The film, then, as already
shown, collects the straying away of peripheral rays of light, and sends
them on to the eye-piece, and greatly assists in rendering the image
more perfect, and materially aids in the removal of residuary secondary
aberrations; while with air, or dry objectives, a certain amount of
aberration takes place, sufficient to affect the pencils on their passage
from the radiant to the medium of the front lens, adding a considerable
ratio to the total spherical aberration with the objective, which,
in the case of wide angles, increases disproportionately from the
axis outwards. This can only be corrected by a rough method of
balancing; that is, by introducing an excess of opposite aberration
in the posterior lens. An uncorrected residuum, rapidly increasing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
with larger apertures, is then left, and this appears in the image
amplified by the total power of the objective, so that with a non-homogeneous
medium there is a maximum angular aperture which
cannot be surpassed without undergoing a perceptible loss of definition,
provided working distance is required. If we abolish the anterior
aberration for all colours, by an immersion fluid which is equal to
cover-glass in refractive and dispersive power, the difficulty is at
once overcome. If, for instance, we have an objective of 140&deg; in
glass (= 1·25 <small>N.A.</small>) and water as the immersion fluid, the aberration
in front would affect a pencil of 140&deg;. Substituting a homogeneous
medium, the same pencil, contracted to the equivalent angle in that
medium of 112&deg;, will be admitted to the front lens without any
aberration, and may be made to emerge from the curved surface
also without any disturbing aberration, but contracted to an angle
varying from 70&deg; to 90&deg;. The first considerable spherical aberration
of the pencil then occurs at the anterior surface of the <i>second</i> lens,
where the maximum obliquity of the rays is already considerably
diminished.</p>

<div class="table w100">
<div class="tcell w50">
<img id="fig_119" src="images/fig_119.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 119.</p></div>

<div class="tcell w50">
<img id="fig_119a" src="images/fig_119a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 119<i>a</i>.</p></div></div>

<p><a href="#fig_119">Figs. 119</a> and 119<i>a</i> will doubtless make this clearer. If the
objective of 140&deg; works with water (<a href="#fig_119">Fig. 119</a>), there would be a
cone of rays extending up to 70&deg; on both sides of the axis, <i>and this
large cone would be submitted to spherical aberration at the front
surface a</i>. But with homogeneous immersion  <a href="#fig_119">Fig. 119</a><i>a</i>) the whole
cone of 112&deg; is admitted to the front lens without any aberration,
there being no refraction at the plane surface; and as the spherical
surface of the front lens is without notable spherical aberration, the
incident pencil is brought from the focus <small>F</small> to the conjugate focus <small>F′</small>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
and contracted to an angle of divergence of 70&deg;-90&deg; <i>without
having undergone any spherical aberration at all</i>.</p>

<p>The problem of correcting a very wide-angled objective has thus
been reduced by the homogeneous oil-immersion system, both in theory
and practice.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<h3>Abbe’s Test-plate.</h3>

<p>Abbe designed the test-plate (<a href="#fig_120">Fig. 120</a>) for testing the spherical
and chromatic aberrations of objectives, and estimating the thickness
of cover-glasses corresponding to the most perfect correction: six
glasses, having the exact thickness marked on each, 0·09 to 0·24 mm.,
cemented in succession on a slip, their lower surface silvered and
engraved with parallel lines, the contours of which form the test.
These being coarsely ruled are easily resolved by the lowest powers;
yet, from the extreme thinness of the silver, they form also a delicate
test for objectives of the highest power and widest aperture. The
test-plate in its original size is seen in <a href="#fig_120">Fig. 120</a>, with one of the circles
enlarged.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_120" src="images/fig_120.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 120.&mdash;Abbe’s Test-plate for estimating thickness of glass-covers.</p></div>

<p>To examine an objective of large aperture, the discs must be
focussed in succession, observing in each case the quality of the
image in the centre of the field, and the variation produced by
using, alternately, central and very oblique illumination.</p>

<p>When the objective is perfectly corrected for spherical aberration,
the outlines of the lines in the centre of the field will be perfectly
sharp by oblique illumination, and without any nebulous doubling
or indistinctness of the edges. If, after exactly adjusting the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
objective for oblique light, central illumination is used, no alteration
of the focus should be necessary to show the outlines with equal
sharpness.</p>

<p>If an objective fulfils these conditions with any one of the discs,
it is free from spherical aberration when used with cover-glasses of
that thickness. On the other hand, if every disc shows nebulous
doubling, or an indistinct appearance of the edges of the line with
oblique illumination, or, if the objective requires a different focal
adjustment to get equal sharpness with central as with oblique light,
the spherical correction of the objective is more or less imperfect.</p>

<p>Nebulous doubling with oblique illumination indicates over-correction
of the marginal zone; indistinctness of the edges without
marked nebulosity indicates under-correction of the zone; an alteration
of the focus for oblique and central illumination points to an absence of
concurrent action of the separate zones, which may be due to either
an average under or over correction, or to irregularity in the convergence
of the rays.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_121" src="images/fig_121.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 121.&mdash;Zeiss’s Cover-glass Gauge.</p></div>

<h3>COVER-GLASS GAUGE.</h3>

<p>Zeiss has gone a step further to lay the microscopist’s ghost of the
cover-glass. He invented a measurer (<a href="#fig_121">Fig. 121</a>) whereby the precise
determination of thickness of glass-covers can be obtained. This
measurement is effected by a clip projecting from a circular box;
the reading is given by an indicator moving over a divided circle on
the lid of the box. The divisions seen cut round the circumference
show <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub>ths of a millimeter. This ingenious gauge measures
upwards of 5 mm.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<p>This necessary and important digression has led me away from
the consideration of the achromatic objective, and to which I shall
now return.</p>

<h3>English Immersion and Dry Objectives.</h3>

<p>The homogeneous immersion system met with its earliest as well as
its staunchest advocates among English opticians. Among its more
energetic supporters were Messrs. Powell and Lealand, who were the
first to construct a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>-inch immersion objective on a formula of their
own, and which was found to resolve test-objects not before capable
of resolution by their dry objectives. This
encouraged them to make a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub>-inch, acquired
by Dr. Woodward for the Army Medical
Department, Washington, and subsequently
a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>25</sub>-inch; neither of which surpassed their
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>-inch in aperture, and a new formula was
tried in the construction of their first oil-immersion
objective. This had a duplex
front, and two double backs; but even this
did not quite accomplish what was expected
of it, and another change was subsequently
made; the anterior front combination became
greater than a hemisphere&mdash;a balloon-lens.
This at once gave an increase of aperture to
a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch objective of 1·43 numerical aperture.
After some few more trials a more important change of the
formula took place. The front lens was made of flint-glass, and
the combination took the form represented in diagram (<a href="#fig_122">Fig. 122</a>).
This, on an enlarged scale, represents Powell’s <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch numerical
aperture 1·50. It is a homogeneous apochromatic immersion of
high quality and very flat field. It will be noticed that in this
combination the four curves of the lenses are very deep compared
with those of other opticians.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p>Fig. 122.&mdash;Powell and
Lealand’s <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-in. Oil-immersion
Objective,
drawn on a scale of 6-1.</p></div>

<p><i>Messrs. Ross</i> have made many important improvements and changes
in the construction of their several series of achromatic objectives;
the calculations and formul&aelig; for which were made exclusively for
them by Dr. Schrœder. The list is too long to quote, but most of
these lenses are of a high-class character, and work with admirable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
precision. Among the best of their objectives, I can commend a 1-inch
of 30&deg; and two oil-immersions, a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>-inch of 1·20 and a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch of 1·25
numerical aperture, each of which bear the highest oculars equally
well; a good test, as I have always maintained, of excellence. Their
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>-inch has a somewhat larger aperture, and therefore shows a fine
image of the podura scale. The finish of Ross’s several series of
objectives fully maintains the high character and reputation of this
old-established firm of opticians.</p>

<p><i>Messrs. R. and J. Beck</i> have bestowed great attention upon the
improvement of their dry-objective series, much in demand for
histological work, especially among the students
of city hospitals, who usually commence their
pathological work with the cheaper forms of
objectives. In that case an inch objective of
about 25&deg; air angle, a &frac12;-inch of not less than
40&deg;, and a &frac14;-inch or <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>5</sub>-inch magnifying from 50
to 250 diameters, is quite sufficient for most of
their work. For bacteriological research, Messrs.
Beck supply a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub>-inch immersion taken from a
series, having a high aperture and a better
finish at a moderate price. Their <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>-inch immersion
has in my hands proved a serviceable power
for bacteriological research; it requires a good
sub-stage illuminating achromatic condenser to obtain the best
results.</p>

<div class="figright">

<p>Fig. 123.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub>-in.
English Combination,

<p><i>Messrs. Watson and Sons</i> have much enhanced their reputation by
the marked improvement lately brought about in the manufacture of
their whole series of objectives. This probably is chiefly due to the
introduction of the <i>Jena</i> glass into their manufacture, and which
has enabled them to give increase of aperture to one series in
particular, that of the para-chromatic, all of which in consequence are
of very high quality. It is difficult to particularise their several
objectives, the whole having special features in proportion to their
magnifying powers, while much care seems to have been bestowed on
them for the elimination of residual colour. A <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>-inch with correction
collar is comprised of a single deep and rather thick front lens,
plano-concave flint, and double convex-crown for the middle and
triple combination for the back, the latter consisting of two crown
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
lenses cemented to a dense flint (<a href="#fig_124">Fig. 124</a>) drawn to scale of 5-1,
with lined portions intended to represent the flint, and white the
crown glass lenses of the combination. The initial magnification
of this objective is 83 diameters, and the numerical aperture ·94.
This superior objective can be had for the
small sum of &pound;2. Another remarkably
useful and cheap objective, their 1-inch
numerical aperture 0·21, consists of two
achromatic systems forming the front and
back with the separation between them
of about half an inch, and may also be
especially recommended for students’ work.</p>

<p>In the accompanying diagram the lenses
are drawn on too large a scale, and therefore
the distance between the two combinations
should be much greater.</p>

<p>Among the more useful of Watson’s
series, the 1-inch, the &frac12;-inch, and the
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub>-inch, together with the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>-inch dry-objective, and a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>9</sub>-inch, will be
found the most serviceable.</p>

<p><i>Messrs. Baker</i> have their own series of objectives, most of which
are so very nearly allied to those of the continental opticians; and
what has been said of Zeiss’s and Leitz’s
objectives may be taken to apply also
to Baker’s, who have an established
reputation for their histological series,
all of which are well suited for students’
and class-room work.</p>

<p><i>Messrs. Swift and Son</i> have a new
series of objectives, semi-apochromatic and
pan-aplanatic, most of which are excellent
in quality and show increased flatness of
field together with that of achromatism;
the index of refraction in each series
having been correctly determined together with exact radial focal
distance, thus affording more available aperture. I may select for
special commendation their <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch &pound;5 5<i>s.</i> homogeneous immersion
objective, which is in every way suitable for bacteriological work;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
its definition is very good, as is seen in a micro-photograph of podura
scale, given further on. Their dry <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub>-inch can be had for &pound;1 16<i>s.</i>&mdash;a
marvel of cheapness. Of their general series the most useful for
histological work are the &frac12;-inch, the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>-inch at &pound;1 12<i>s.</i>, and their
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>5</sub>-inch of numerical aperture 0·87 at &pound;3.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Pillischer</i>, of Bond Street, has manufactured many excellent
objectives. A fine homogeneous oil-immersion <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch numerical
aperture 1·25 is worthy of special notice; it will be found suitable
for bacteriological work; it has fine definition with a considerable
amount of penetration.</p>

<p>A reference to the above table will at once show that the nomenclature
of objectives expresses at once the initial magnifying powers,
but as makers have great difficulty in so calculating their formul&aelig;
so as to obtain the <i>exact</i> power, these figures must be taken as
approximate. Thus a &frac14;-inch, which should magnify 40 diameters if
true to its description, might actually magnify a little more or less.</p>

<p>The magnifying powers of Zeiss’s and other apochromatic objectives
can be ascertained by dividing the focal length of the objective in

<p>The total magnification, when any eye-piece is working in conjunction
with an objective, is ascertained by multiplying the initial
power of the objective by that of the eye-piece.</p>

<p>The above calculations are all for a 10-inch tube-length. Should,
however, a shorter or longer length of body be employed, the magnification
can at once be ascertained by a proportion sum. If the
magnification be 180 with 10-inch tube-length, what would it be
with a 6-inch body&mdash;10 : 6 :: 180 = 108 diameters.</p>

<p>Abbe designed three different forms of eye-pieces: 1, the searcher
eye-piece; 2, the working eye-piece; and 3, the projecting eye-piece.
The <i>Searcher</i> is a negative form of low power. The working is both
negative and positive, the positive form of which is constructed on
a newer principle; while the projection is chiefly intended for microphotography,
its field being small and its definition superlatively
sharp. These are severally explained among eye-pieces.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<h3>High-Power Objectives.</h3>

<p><i>Points of Importance for securing the best results with High-power
Objectives.</i>&mdash;Always give to the body-tube of the microscope the length
for which the objective is corrected, 0·160 mm. for the short
continental tube, and 0·250 mm. for the English tube (10-inch).
Employ both dry and immersion objectives mounted for correction,
commencing with a numerical aperture of 0·75 (that is about 100&deg;
in air). If the graduation is not given in thickness of cover-glass
apply to the maker to correct this omission.</p>

<p>With the homogeneous oil-immersion objective it is highly necessary
to utilise all marginal pencils of light, to optically unite the
upper lens of the condenser with the preparation as well as the front
lens of the objective by means of a liquid having the same index of
refraction or at least equal to that of the immersion. <i>Cedar Oil</i> has
been generally adopted for the purpose mentioned, the better way
of using which is as follows: place a drop on the centre of the
front objective, or on the top of the cover-glass, and then lower the
objective by means of the coarse adjustment until it comes in
contact with the oil, and carefully bring into focus by the fine
adjustment. If the slide is held between the finger and thumb of
one hand and moved from side to side, while the other hand is
working the fine adjustment, there can be no danger of injuring
either the objective or the specimen. Before putting the microscope
away, take a fine camel-hair brush dipped in ether, alcohol, or
methylated spirit, and carefully remove the oil from the objective
and the glass cover of the object; a soft chamois leather or cambric
pocket handkerchief will dry it off, or a piece of fine white blotting
paper answers equally well. Should the lens come accidentally into
contact with the Canada balsam, it must be very carefully removed
either by ether or alcohol. The former is by far the safest, as
alcohol, if not very carefully used, quickly dissolves out the balsam
and loosens the cover-glass of the object.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<h3>Achromatic Condensers.</h3>

<p><i>The Achromatic Condenser</i> can no longer be classed among the
<i>accessories</i> of the microscope, since it is an absolutely indispensable
part of its optical arrangements. Its value, then, cannot be overrated,
and the corrections of the lenses which enter into the construction
of the condenser should be made as perfect as they can be
made&mdash;in fact, as nearly approaching that of the objective as it is
possible to make them. It may therefore be of interest to know
something of the rise and progress of the achromatic condenser. In
my first chapter I have noticed the earlier attempts made by
Dr. Wollaston, whose experiments led him to fit to the underside
of the stage of his microscope a short tube, in which a
plano-convex lens of about three-quarters of an inch focal length
was made to slide up and down (afterwards moved up and down
by two knobs); to improve definition he placed a stop between
the mirror and the lens. The stop was found to act better when
placed between the lens and the object. From this improvement
Dr. Wollaston enunciated that “the intensity of illumination will
depend upon the diameter of the illuminating lens and the proportion
of the image to the perforation, and may be regulated
according to the wish of the observer.” Dujardin in France and
Tully in England were at work in the same direction. The former
a year or two later on contrived an instrument, which he termed an
<i>eclairage</i>, to remedy the defects of Wollaston’s, and for illuminating
objects with achromatic light. This was submitted for approval to
Sir David Brewster, who, when the use of the achromatic condenser
was first broached, used these encouraging words:&mdash;“I have no
hesitation in saying that the apparatus for illumination requires to
be as perfect as the apparatus for vision, and on this account I
would recommend that the illuminating lens should be perfectly free
from chromatic and spherical aberration, and that the greatest care
be taken to exclude all extraneous light both from the object and
eye of the observer.” This far-seeing observer in optical science has
borne good fruit, and the outcome of his views is seen in the great
development and improvement of the achromatic condenser. In
1839 Andrew Ross made his first useful form of condenser, and gave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
rules for the illumination of objects in an article written for the
“Penny Cyclop&aelig;dia.” These, epitomised, read as follows: 1. That
the illuminating cone should equal the aperture of the objective, and
no more. 2. With daylight, a white cloud being in focus, the
object has to be placed nearly at the apex of the cone. The object
is seen better sometimes above and sometimes below the apex of the
cone. 3. With lamplight a bull’s-eye lens is to be used, to
parallelise the rays, so that they may be similar to those coming
from the white cloud. It has
been seen that Mr. Lister foreshadowed
the sub-stage condenser.</p>

<p>The early form of Ross’s condenser
consists of two small
brass tubes made to slide one
in the other. To the outer
one is attached a flat brass
plate which slides underneath
the stage of the microscope,
and by means of a screw the
adjustment of the axis of the
illuminator is effected. The
upper portion of the apparatus
carries the achromatic
combination, which by a rack and pinion movement is brought
nearer to, or removed further from the object on the stage.
The several parts of the illuminator unscrew, so that the lenses
may be used either combined for high powers, or separated for
low powers.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_126" src="images/fig_126.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 126.&mdash;Original form of Gillett’s
Achromatic Condenser.</p></div>

<p>Messrs. Smith &amp; Beck greatly improved upon Ross’s condenser
by adding another achromatic lens to the combination, three being
employed when used with high-power objectives and two or even
one with the lower, the adjustment and focussing being made by
rack and pinion arrangement beneath the stage. Some further
changes for the better were made in the condenser by Powell, and
in 1850 an amateur microscopist, Mr. Gillett, fully grasping the
value of controlling the cone of rays passing into the microscope,
devised a new form of condenser, in connection with which a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
revolving series of diaphragms of different values were made to pass
between the achromatic lenses and the source of light.</p>

<p>Andrew Ross constructed the first condenser on Gillett’s principle,
and this proved to be one of the most successful pieces of apparatus
contrived. <i>Gillett’s Condenser</i> consists of an achromatic lens <i>c</i>, about
equal to an object-glass of one quarter of an inch focal length, with
an aperture of 80&deg;. This lens is screwed into the top of a brass tube,
and intersecting which, at an angle of about 25&deg;, is a circular
rotating brass plate <i>a b</i>, provided with a conical diaphragm, having
a series of circular apertures of different sizes <i>h g</i>, each of which in
succession, as the diaphragm is rotated, proportionally limits the
light transmitted through the illuminating lens. The circular plate
in which the conical diaphragm is fixed is provided with a spring
and catch <i>e f</i>, the latter indicating when an aperture is central with
the illuminating lens, also the number of the aperture as marked on
the graduated circular plate. Three of these apertures have central
discs for circularly oblique illumination, allowing only the passage
of a hollow cone of light to illuminate the object. The illuminator
above described is placed in the secondary stage <i>i i</i>, which is situated
below the general stage of the microscope, and consists of a cylindrical
tube having a rotatory motion, also a rectangular adjustment, which
is effected by means of two screws <i>l m</i>, one in front, and the other
on the left side of its frame. This tube receives and supports all the
various illuminating and polarising apparatus, and other auxiliaries.</p>

<p><i>Directions for using Gillett’s Condenser.</i>&mdash;In the adjustment of
the compound body of the microscope for using with Gillett’s
illuminator, one or two important points should be observed&mdash;first,
centricity; and secondly, the fittest compensation of the light to be
employed. With regard to the first, place the illuminator in the
cylindrical tube, and press upwards the sliding bar <i>k</i> in its place,
until checked by the stop; move the microscope body either
vertically or inclined for convenient use; and, with the rack and
pinion which regulates the sliding bar, bring the illuminating lens to
a level with the upper surface of the object-stage; then move the
arm which holds the microscope body to the right, until it meets
the stop, whereby its central position is attained; adjust the reflecting
mirror so as to throw light up the illuminator, and place upon
the mirror a piece of clean white paper to obtain a uniform disc of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
light. Then put on the low eye-piece, and a low power (the half-inch),
as more convenient for the mere adjustment of the instrument;
place a transparent object on the stage, adjust the microscope-tube,
until vision is obtained of the object; then remove the object,
and take off the cap of the eye-piece, and in its place fix on the
eye-glass called the “centring eye-glass,”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> which will be found
greatly to facilitate the adjustment now under consideration, namely,
the centring of the compound body of the microscope with the
illuminating apparatus of whatever description. The centring-glass,
being thus affixed to the top of the eye-piece, is adjusted by its
sliding-tube (without disturbing the microscope-tube) until the
images of the diaphragms in the object-glass
and centring lens are distinctly
seen. The illuminator should now be
moved by means of the left-hand screw
on the secondary stage while looking
through the microscope, to enable the
observer to recognize the diaphragm
belonging to the illuminator, and by
means of the two adjusting screws to
place this diaphragm central with the
others: thus the first condition, that of
centricity, will be accomplished. Remove
the white paper from the mirror, and also
the centring-glass, and replace the cap
on the eye-piece, also the object on the stage, of which distinct
vision should then be obtained by the rack and pinion, or fine
screw adjustment, should it have become deranged.</p>

<img id="fig_127" src="images/fig_127.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 127.&mdash;The Ross Improved
Achromatic Condenser, with
diaphragm stops.</p></div>

<p>The re-publication of the original directions is given with the view
of showing what a clear conception Gillett had of the value of his
invention. The careful directions given for centring must be regarded
with interest, although nearly superseded by the centring
screw arrangement in connection with the sub-stage. The best
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
results, he goes on to say, will be secured by using the plain mirror
and focussing the window-bar on the object, while a white-cloud
illuminator will afford as much light as may be required. It is
a mistake to suppose that direct light is more critical than indirect.
As a rule, the student is given to over-illuminate the object. These
questions will, however, be discussed further on.</p>

<p>Very many modifications of Gillett’s condenser have, since 1850,
become known to microscopists. Ross’s present improved form
(<a href="#fig_127">Fig. 127</a>) is made to drop into the sub-stage of the microscope,
and when adjusted, is an extremely efficient instrument. The
optical part is similar to a <sup>4</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>-inch objective. It has two sets of
revolving diaphragms, with apertures and stops for showing surface
markings in a perfect manner.</p>

<h3>Abbe’s Condenser.</h3>

<p>The essential feature of this condenser is its short focus, which
collects the light reflected by the mirror, so as to form a cone of
rays of very large aperture,
having its focus in the plane
of the object.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_128" src="images/fig_128.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 128.&mdash;The Iris Diaphragm, and
carrier for Stops.</p></div>

<p>The full aperture of the
illuminating cone should only
be used when finely granular
and deeply stained particles
(protoplasm, bacteria, &amp;c.) are
being examined with objectives
of large aperture. In
all cases the cone must be
suitably reduced, either by an
iris, or other form of diaphragm
(<i>central illumination</i>). By placing the diaphragm excentrically,
by means of rack-work attached to the carrier, the central
rays are excluded and a certain extra-axial portion of the illuminating
pencil falls upon the object (<i>oblique illumination</i>). When the
diaphragm is thus excentrically placed, this oblique pencil can be
directed from all sides by rotating the carrier round the optic axis.
The central stop diaphragm shuts off all the axial and transmits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
only the marginal rays, thus producing <i>dark-ground illumination</i>.
The iris diaphragm (<a href="#fig_128">Fig. 128</a>) is so shaped that the edge of its
smallest opening closely approximates the object-slide on the stage.</p>

<div class="figright">

<p class="caption">Fig. 129.&mdash;The Abbe Condenser, detached

<p>The Abbe condenser is the most popular form in use, for all
purposes. Owing to the large
aperture of the cone of light
which it projects, it can be
employed with the highest
powers; by removing the top
lens it can also be used with
low powers. Dark ground illumination
may be obtained with
it up to a &frac14;-inch objective.</p>

<p>The condenser is made in two
forms of 1·2 and 1·4 numerical
aperture by Messrs. Watson.
The lenses are mounted in
aluminium. <a href="#fig_130">Fig. 130</a> is in more
general use, but by workers
with high powers <a href="#fig_131">Fig. 131</a> is
preferred, as it ensures the
most oblique illumination with
objectives of largest aperture. It is preferred for photo-micrographic
purposes.</p>

<img id="fig_132" src="images/fig_132.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 132.&mdash;The Optical Arrangement

Condenser.</p></div>

<p><i>Watson’s Achromatic Condenser</i> (<a href="#fig_132">Fig. 132</a>), 1·0 numerical aperture,
shown in section, although originally designed for use with the
micro-spectroscope, is equally efficient for ordinary purposes. This
condenser transmits a larger aplanatic cone of light than Abbe’s.
It may therefore be employed with higher power objectives, and by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
removing the top lens it is just as useful a condenser for lower
powers. Being constructed with lenses of an unusually large size,
it is well adapted for use with the
micro-spectroscope. It is certainly one
of the best all-round condensers in use.
The new Schott glass enters into the
construction of the lenses, and these
are mounted in aluminium.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_133" src="images/fig_133.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 133.&mdash;Powell’s Achromatic Condenser.</p></div>

<p>Many microscopists consider on the
whole that Powell’s sub-stage apochromatic
condenser with collar correction
(<a href="#fig_133">Fig. 133</a>) surpasses that of Abbe.
The mechanical arrangement of Powell’s
is very simple: the correction collar is
similar to that of an ordinary objective, it has a steeper spiral slot
and only half a revolution of movement; a long arc is fixed to the
collar so that it may conveniently be reached by the finger. It is so
constructed as to turn easily and smoothly at the slightest touch.
The collar moves only the back lens of the combination, leaving
the mount rigid. The diaphragms are regulated by <small>A</small> and <small>B</small>.

<p>The object of the correctional movement is to increase the
maximum aplanatic aperture of the condenser by separating the
lenses. If the back of a wide-angled objective be examined when an
object is illuminated by the full aperture of the condenser, the edge
of the flame being in focus, it will be noticed that the illuminated
portion of the back lens will be oval and pointed instead of circular.
Also that when the condenser is racked up, although the external
shape of the illuminated portion becomes more circular, two dark
patches will appear on either side of the centre, showing the operation
of the spherical aberration of the condenser. If under these circumstances
the lenses are separated by means of the collar adjustment,
the black spots will be closed up, and a circular and evenly-illuminated
disc of illumination of a larger size will result. The
wheel of diaphragms, or a series of graduated diaphragm discs to
drop into a holder, is intended for critical work; the diaphragm
can always be recorded, and the identical illuminating cone
reproduced.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>Hence we have a simple method of graduating apertures between
any two contiguous diaphragms; if, for example, we place the
lever to the left, so that the lens may be separated as far as
possible, and use a No. 6 diaphragm, and if, on examining the
object, it is thought that the illuminating cone is not large enough,
and if when No. 7 is turned on it is found too much, we can go back
to No. 6, and by turning the lever 60&deg; towards the right, closing the
lenses and increasing the power a little, we shall obtain an aperture
somewhere between Nos. 6 and 7 diaphragm. Thus we can by means
of the correction collar graduate the aperture with the facility as
with an iris, and we can record any particular aperture with a degree
of accuracy foreign to the iris. It must be admitted, however, that
the cone of light transmitted by the condenser
is a very small one.</p>

<p>Powell also supplies an apochromatic oil-immersion
condenser, numerical aperture
1·40, but without collar correction; <a href="#fig_134">Fig. 134</a>
shows the sliding tube lowered by arm A and
cell B withdrawn for changing stops, which
can be done without altering the focus of
the condenser. <a href="#fig_134">Fig. 134</a><i>a</i> shows the cell B
closed and raised by arm A close to the back
lens of optical combination. In <a href="#fig_134">Fig. 134</a><i>b</i>
six of the principal stops are shown. Powell’s
dry apochromatic condenser, of nearly 0·9 aplanatic cone, is also very
good; but the high price of all is a bar to their more general use.
The speciality of these is the conversion of axis light into condensed
oblique incident light by the refraction of the condenser.</p>

<p>Messrs. R. &amp; J. Beck have various forms of achromatic condensers,
some of which partake of a somewhat elaborate arrangement; others
are simple and inexpensive, to suit the students’ microscope; as when
the light of the concave mirror proves insufficient for any object
requiring intense transmitted light, an achromatic condenser must
be adapted to even the students’ form of microscope. The latest
form of condenser (<a href="#fig_135">Fig. 135</a>) is fitted with revolving stops and iris
diaphragm, and other appliances for obtaining satisfactory results.</p>

in working with the microscope to be enabled to rapidly change
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
the illumination, and for this reason this compound form of condenser
has been constructed. It consists of an upper portion A,
a wide-angle condenser, the aperture of which can be reduced at will
by an iris diaphragm, moved by the lever B. This can be used for
all other purposes. Below this diaphragm is a plate C, which can be
swung back out of position at will, as shown in outline. Into a cell in
this plate the stops D can be dropped, and the condenser can be used
for dark field illumination, or for high
powers as an oblique illuminator. A
large-size polarising prism E, fastens to
the plate C, and can be removed when
not required. In this way any of the
various modes of illumination may be
separately or conjointly obtained.</p>

<p>Their condenser (<a href="#fig_137">Fig. 137</a>) has a large
aperture, and facilities for rotating the
series of diaphragms. It is available for
either dry or immersion objectives up to
1·3 numerical aperture on diatoms, and
wet or dry histological objects. The spherical form of the front is
worked by a milled-head that rotates a series of lenses and diaphragms.
It also avoids the inconvenience of having the connecting fluid drawn
away by capillary attraction, as would be the case if mounted on a
flat surface. It is also less in the way of the sub-stage movements.

<p class="caption">Fig. 138.&mdash;Watson’s Parachromatic Condenser.</p></div>

<p><i>The Parachromatic Condenser</i> of Messrs. Watson (<a href="#fig_138">Fig. 138</a>) was
made to meet a demand for a condenser giving a large solid cone of
illumination free from colour. The optical part of this condenser
consists of a full hemispherical front lens, and the middle and back
combinations of such forms as to produce the necessary corrections.
The Jena phosphate crown and silicate flints are used in its
manufacture, and to these are due its special qualities. The total
aperture of the condenser is 1·0, and it yields an aplanatic aperture
of ·90 numerical aperture. The magnifying power is <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub>ths of an
inch. From this it will be seen that it is especially suitable for use
with high-power objectives.</p>

<p>It can also be employed without the front lens, when the magnifying
power is <sup>4</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>ths of an inch, and the numerical aperture ·35. It
is mounted in an exceedingly convenient manner, the iris diaphragm
being fitted in such a way as to be absolutely central with the
optical system.</p>

<p>The arc through which the handle controlling the iris travels is
divided, and indicates the aperture at which the condenser may be
working at any time. An important feature in this condenser is
that it is almost wholly free from colour. As a rule condensers of
the same form are found difficult to work with, because of the small
diameter of the field or back lens. This difficulty has been successfully
overcome by increasing the size of this lens, and the whole of
which is fully utilised.</p>

<p>Most London opticians have their own especial form of achromatic
condenser, designed for and fitted to their several stands and
objectives, varying from a small price to the more expensively-fitted
accessories.

<p>Messrs. Swift’s illuminating apparatus (<a href="#fig_139">Fig. 139</a>) is conveniently
supplied with numerous useful appliances. The optical combination A
is computed to be used as an effective spot lens from a 3-inch objective
up to a sixth. C C are two small milled heads by means of which
the optical combination A is centred to the axis of the objective.
The revolving diaphragm E has four apertures for the purpose of
receiving central stops, oblique light discs, and selenite films. D is
a frame carrying two revolving cells, into one of which a mica film
is placed, which can be revolved with ease over either of the selenites
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
below, whereby changes of colour can be obtained in experimenting
with polarised light. The darts and P A’s indicate the position of
the positive axis of the mica and selenite films, and by this means
results can be recorded, etc. Either of the revolving cells can be
thrown into the centre of the condenser, and there stopped by means
of a spring catch; when so arranged the mica film, &amp;c., may be
revolved in its place by turning the cell D, as both cells are geared
together with fine racked teeth. F is a polarising prism mounted
on an eccentric arm, rendered central when in use, or thrown out, as
seen, when out of use. G is the rack dove-tail slide for indicating
and focussing the condenser on the object. The advantages associated
with this condenser consist in having the polarising prism, selenite
films, dark-ground, and oblique light
stops, so that they may be brought
close under the optical combination.</p>

Condenser.</p></div>

<p>Baker’s Nelson Condenser, shown
in <a href="#fig_140">Fig. 140</a>, is intended for use with
their medium instruments. It has,
however, many pieces of apparatus
essential to those of a higher class.
It is applicable, indeed, to all instruments
having sufficient depth beneath
the stage to receive it. It comprises
an achromatic combination of 90&deg;
aperture, available with all powers up to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>-inch tinted glass for
neutralising the yellow rays of artificial light, focussing adjustment,
dark-ground illuminator, large diaphragm with rotating tube to
carry oblique light stops, small wheel of apertures, polarising prism
with two selenite films, clear aperture, and oblique light-shutter for
low powers.</p>

<p>Baker’s Students’ Condenser (<a href="#fig_141">Fig. 141</a>) is designed to take the place
of Abbe’s, and costs much less. It transmits a larger aplanatic cone
of light, and can be used either with high or low powers by removing
the front lens. It is equally useful for photo-micrographic work.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Mayall’s semi-cylinder or prism for oblique illumination
(<a href="#fig_142">Fig. 142</a>) is a convenient form, as it permits of the semi-cylinder
being tilted and placed excentrically; in this manner, without
immersion contact, and by suitable adjustment, a dry object can be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
viewed with any colour of monochromatic light. If placed in
immersion contact with the slide, the utmost obliquity of incident
light can be obtained. Objects in fluid may be placed on the plane-surface
of the semi-cylinder, and illuminated by ordinary transmitted
light, or rendered “self-luminous” in a dark field, as with the
hemispherical illuminator or Wenham’s immersion paraboloid. A
concave mirror with a double arm is quite sufficient to direct the
illuminating pencil. This semi-cylinder was originally made by
Tolles, of Boston, for measuring apertures, but, at Mr. Mayall’s
suggestion, Messrs. Ross mounted it as an illuminator.</p>

<h3>Oblique Illumination.</h3>

<p><i>Wenham’s Parabolic Condenser.</i>&mdash;Mr. Wenham’s many useful
additions to the microscope and its accessories demand especial notice.
When mention is made of the various immersion condensers (illuminators,
as he preferred to call them), his original right-angled prism,
his truncated hemispherical lens, his immersion paraboloid, and his
reflex illuminator, in which rays beyond the angle of total reflexion
are utilised by reflex action from cover-glass on to the surface of the
object, every one of these well-devised inventions will always be spoken
of in terms of praise. All in their turn conferred a great service
upon the microscope, and enabled the student to clear up difficulties
that stood in the way of developing structure when achromatic lenses
and dry-objectives were considered perfect. The superior illumination
of the object was wholly due to, and effected by, <i>reflected</i> rays from
the object to the aperture of the objective, and obviously, reflex action
could only take place with dry-objectives. This reflex action must be
regarded as Mr. Wenham’s special discovery. It must be observed,
however, that it is not the same as the more modern achromatic
appliances used for throwing <i>direct</i> rays upon the object, and which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
proved the existence of apertures capable of direct transmission up
to 27&deg; measured in the body of the front lens.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_144" src="images/fig_144.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 144.&mdash;Wenham’s
Parabolic Reflector.</p></div>

<p>The most practical of Mr. Wenham’s inventions is probably the
hemispherical lens, since adopted by Messrs. Ross in connection with
their excellent Zentmayer stand, and which has proved eminently
serviceable. But the fact is that devices of the kind for obtaining
direct oblique light require a thin stage, and therefore most of those
who possess the earlier-made microscope stand would doubtless hail the
appearance of any appliance which will convert axial light into oblique
light; as by so doing the possessors of such instruments, in which
the stage is generally of considerable thickness, would enjoy the
pleasure of seeing the best resolution it is
possible to get with their dry-objectives.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p><i>Wenham’s Parabolic Reflector.</i>&mdash;This will be
better understood by reference to <a href="#fig_145">Fig. 145</a>,
which represents it in section A B C, and shows
that the rays of light <i>r r′ r′′</i>, entering perpendicularly
at its surface C, and then reflected
by its parabolic surface A B to a focus at F,
can form no part of the largest pencil of light
admitted by the object-glass and represented
by G F H; but an object placed at F will
interrupt the rays and be strongly illuminated.
A stop at S prevents any light from passing
through direct from the mirror.</p>

<p>In the microscope the <i>parabolic reflector</i> fits into the cylindrical
fitting under the stage, and the adjustment of its focus upon the object
is made by giving it a spiral motion when fitted in&mdash;that is, carefully
pushing it up or down at the same time that it is turned round by
the milled edge B B. It must then be focussed by the rack and
pinion motion. As the rays of light must be parallel when they enter
it, a <i>flat mirror</i>, which in this case should be added to the instrument,
is generally used; daylight will then require only direct reflection,
but the rays from an artificial source will have to be made parallel
by placing a side condenser between the light and the mirror, about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
1&frac34; inch from the former and 4&frac12; inches from the latter. Nearly the
whole surface of the mirror should be equally illuminated; this may
be tested by temporarily placing upon it a card or piece of white paper.
Parallel rays can also be obtained from the concave mirror, if the
light is placed about 2&frac12; inches from it. Dark-ground illumination
is not suitable for very transparent objects&mdash;that is, unless there is
a considerable difference in their index of refraction, or they are
pervaded by air-cells.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_145" src="images/fig_145.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 145.&mdash;Parabolic Reflector.</p></div>

<p>One very remarkable example of this may be seen in the tracheal
system of insects. If any of the transparent larv&aelig; of the various
kinds of gnat be mounted in gelatine and glycerine jelly, slightly
warmed but not enough to kill the insect outright, about the third
day the fluids circulating in the body will be absorbed and replaced
by air. Illuminated by the parabolic condenser, and viewed with a
binocular microscope, and a low power, the gnat-larva becomes a superb
object. The body of the insect is but faintly visible, and in its
place is displayed a marvellous tracheal skeleton, with the tubes
standing out in perspective, shining brilliantly, like a structure of
burnished silver. Unfortunately, such objects are not permanent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
for when the whole of the water dries up, the tracheal tubes either
collapse or become refilled with fluid.</p>

<p>As to the blackness of field, and luminosity of the object, this
depends upon excess of light from the paraboloid received beyond
the angle of aperture of the object-glass. It is found in practice that
more and more of the inner annulus of rays from the paraboloid has
to be stopped off, until at last, with high-angled objectives, it is
scarcely possible to obtain a black field.</p>

<p>The light, on the whole, most suitable for this method of
illumination is lamp, the rays of which should in all cases be
rendered more parallel by means of a large plano-convex lens,
or condenser.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_146" src="images/fig_146.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 146.&mdash;Wenham’s
Hemispherical Lens.</p></div>

<p><i>Wenham’s Immersion Condenser.</i>&mdash;Mr. Wenham, in the year 1856,
described various forms of oblique illuminators, one of which was an
immersion; a simple right-angled prism, connected by a fluid medium
of oil of cloves. This, however, was abandoned for a nearly hemispherical
lens connected with the slide, and
although an improvement, did not touch the
point of excellence Mr. Wenham was looking
for. Ultimately he adopted a semi-circular
disc of glass of the exact form and size represented
in the drawing, <a href="#fig_146">Fig. 146</a>, having
a quarter-inch radius, with a well-polished rounded edge, the sides
being grasped by a simple kind of open clip attached to the sub-stage,
the fluid medium used for connecting the upper surface with the
slide being either water, glycerine, or oil; an increase of oblique
illumination being obtained by swinging the ordinary mirror sideways.
By means of an illuminator of the kind difficult objects mounted in
balsam are resolved. This simple piece of glass collects and concentrates
light in a marvellous manner, and is by no means a bad
substitute for some of the more costly forms of achromatic condenser.
It can be used either in fluid contact with the slide, or dry, as an
ordinary condenser.</p>

<p>Mr. Wenham subsequently contrived a small truncated glass
paraboloid, for use in fluid contact with the slide; water, glycerine,
oil, or other substance being employed as a contact medium. The
rays of light in this illuminator, being internally reflected from a
convex surface of glass, impinge obliquely on the under surface of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
the slide, and are transmitted by the fluid uniting medium, and
internally reflected from the upper surface of the cover-glass to the
objective. To use the reflex illuminator efficiently it must be racked
up to a level with the stage. The centre of rotation is then set true
by a dot on the fitting, seen with a low power, a drop of water is
then placed on the top, and upon this the slide is laid. Minute
objects <i>on the slide</i> must be found either by the aid of a low power,
by their greater brilliancy, or by
rotating the illuminator; the effect on
the podura scale is superb, the whole
scale appearing dotted with bright blue
spots in a zig-zag direction. Objects
for this illuminator should be especially
selected and mounted.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_147" src="images/fig_147.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 147.&mdash;The Amici Prism.</p></div>

<p>The Amici Prism, originally designed
for oblique illumination, consists of a
flattened triangular glass prism, the
two narrower sides of which are slightly convex, while the third or
broadest side forms the reflecting surface. When properly used, it
is capable of transmitting a very oblique pencil of light. The prism
is either mounted, as in <a href="#fig_147">Fig. 147</a>, for slipping into the fitting of the
sub-stage, or on an independent stand, as arranged for Powell’s
microscope, page 85, <a href="#fig_56">Fig. 56</a>.</p>

<h3>Method of Employing the Achromatic Condenser to the
Greatest Advantage.</h3>

<p><i>Its Illumination.</i>&mdash;Good daylight is the best for general work.
The microscope should be placed near a window with a northern
aspect. Direct sunlight should never be utilised; the best light is
that reflected from a white cloud. A good paraffin lamp is the most
serviceable artificial source of light, and it is quite under control.
As an illuminant more often brought into requisition in the smoky
atmosphere of towns, the paraffin lamp is on the whole the handiest
and the most useful. If gas-light can be brought into use as
suggested for micro-photography, with the incandescent mantle, it will
be found to be the purest and best form of artificial illumination
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
for the microscope. Among paraffin lamps those constructed by
Baker and Swift are all that can be desired.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

Arrangement of the Aplanatic

<div class="tcell">
<img id="fig_148" src="images/fig_148.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 148.&mdash;Baker’s Microscope Lamp.</p></div></div>

<p>As the chimneys of these lamps are made of metal, and blackened,
no reflected light disturbs the eye. Care must be taken to have the
wick evenly trimmed; the metal chimney has a glazed front, giving
exit to the rays of light, the flat of the flame being used with low
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
powers, and the image of the flame being reflected by a plane mirror
to give equal illumination of the whole field. In working with high
powers, the lamp is turned with the flame edge-wise, and at the
same time the mirror must be dispensed with. By working, as it is
termed, directly on the edge of the flame, the illumination is greatly
increased, and a band of light can be concentrated on any part of
the preparation it is desired to make a careful study of.</p>

<p>To obtain the best results, time and care must be given to the
illumination of the object. The lamp and microscope having been
placed in position, a low power is first used and the smallest
diaphragm. On looking through the microscope it will probably be
observed that the image of the diaphragm is not in the centre of the
field; by moving the centring screw of the condenser this may be
adjusted. The low power is then replaced by a high power, the
largest diaphragm used, and the bacteria or diatom brought into
focus. The diaphragm must now be replaced by one of medium
size, and by racking the condenser up and down, a point will be
arrived at when the image of the edge of the flame appears as an
intensely bright band of light. If this is not exactly in the centre
of the field the centring screw of the condenser must again be
adjusted. With regard to the use of diaphragms, various sizes
should be tried while focussing with the fine adjustment, at the
same time using the correction colour; in this way we obtain the
sharpest possible image. When the condenser has been accurately
centred, it will still be necessary to focus it for each individual
specimen, so as to correct for difference in the thickness of slides
and the layers of mounting medium. Correction for different thickness
of cover-glasses must be made by the aid of the collar adjustment
in the following way: a high-power eye-piece is substituted
for the ordinary eye-piece, and the faults in the image will thereby
be intensified. By moving the collar completely round, first in one
direction and then in the other, while carefully observing the effect
of the image, it will be seen to become obviously worse whichever
way the collar is turned. The collar must then be turned through
gradually diminishing distances until an intermediate point is reached
at which the best image results with the high-power eye-piece, and
on replacing this by the low-power eye-piece the sharpest possible
image will be obtained.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<p><i>Effect of the Sub-stage Condenser.</i>&mdash;The sub-stage condenser gives
the most powerful illumination when it has been racked up until it
almost touches the specimen. It produces a cone of rays of very
short focus, and the apex of the cone should correspond with the
particular bacterium or group of bacterias under observation. The
effect of the condenser without a diaphragm is to obliterate what Koch
has termed a <i>structure picture</i>. If the component parts of a tissue
section were colourless and of the same refractive power as the
medium in which the section is mounted, nothing would be visible
under the microscope. As, however, the cells and their nuclei and
the tissues do not differ in this respect, the rays which pass through
them are diffracted, and an image of lines and shadows is developed.
If in such a tissue there were minute coloured objects, and if it were
possible to mount the tissue in a medium of exactly the same
refractive power, the tissue being then invisible, the detection of the
coloured objects would be much facilitated. This is exactly what is
required in dealing with bacteria which has been stained with aniline
dyes, and the desired result can be obtained by the use of the
sub-stage condenser.</p>

<p>If we use the full aperture of the condenser the greatly converged
rays play on the component parts of the tissue, light enters from all
sides, the shadows disappear, and the structure picture is lost. If
now a diaphragm is inserted, so that we are practically only dealing
with parallel rays, the structure picture reappears. As the diaphragm
is gradually increased in size the structure picture gradually
becomes less and less distinct, while the colour picture, the image
of the stained bacteria, becomes more and more intense. When,
therefore, bacteria in the living condition and unstained tissues are
examined, a diaphragm must be used, and when the attention is to
be concentrated upon the stained bacteria in a section or in a cover-glass
preparation the diaphragm must be removed and the field
flooded with light&mdash;(Crookshank).</p>

<p>The wide-angle condenser, it will be understood, consists of
a combination of lenses, which concentrate all the light entering
them to a small point, and the condenser must be so accurately
focussed that this brilliant cone of light, when it emerges from the
upper lens of the condenser, falls upon the object from all directions,
forming a wide-angle cone of light, at the apex of which the object
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
must be placed (see <a href="#fig_149">Fig. 149</a>). That is to say, the object is illuminated
by a cone of rays passing through it in all directions.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_149" src="images/fig_149.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 149.&mdash;Front Lens of Condenser.</p></div>

<p>There are, however, objects which require a fully illuminated
field, when the lamp should be turned round and the Herschel lens
condenser (shown in section, <a href="#fig_148">Fig. 148</a>) should be used to collect the
light and throw it upon the mirror. For moderate powers, as a
four-tenth or one-fifth, the condenser
should be used a little
below the focus to give an even
illumination over the whole field.
Moreover, as to the use of the
condenser for defining general
objects, it must be borne in mind
that to show different kinds of structure different apertures in the
iris diaphragm are necessary, and that whereas some objects show
their structure better with a large angle of light cut down in
intensity by the use of blue glass, others show better with a small
pencil of direct rays. For the resolution of diatoms it is often
necessary to use oblique light only, and for this purpose diaphragms
with central patches are used, the iris diaphragm being opened to its
full extent. An annular ring of oblique light emerges from the
condenser upon the object, and it is in this manner also that
dark-ground illumination is obtained with moderate and low powers.</p>

<h3>THE DIAPHRAGM.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_150" src="images/fig_150.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 150.&mdash;The Diaphragm.</p></div>

<p>The early form of diaphragm in use was that shown in <a href="#fig_150">Fig. 150</a>.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_151" src="images/fig_151.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 151.&mdash;Shutter Diaphragm.</p></div>

<p>It consists simply of a circular brass plate with a series of circular
openings of different sizes, arranged to revolve upon another plate
by a central pin or axis, the last being also provided with an opening
as large as the largest in the diaphragm-plate, and corresponding in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
situation to the axis of the microscope body. The holes in the
diaphragm-plate are centred and retained in place by a bent spring
in the second plate, which rubs against the edge of the diaphragm-plate
and catches in a notch. The
blank space shuts off the light from
the mirror when condensed light is
about to be used. It is usually made
to fit in under the stage of the microscope.
This has been almost superseded
by the iris diaphragm, originally
designed by Wales, of America. It was
made by this optician for his working
students’ microscope. An early form
of the iris diaphragm is seen in <a href="#fig_151">Fig. 151</a>.
By pressing upon the lever handle at the side the aperture gradually
closes up, and without for a moment losing sight of the object under
examination.</p>

<h3>The Mirror.</h3>

<p>The mode in which an object is illuminated is, in the words
of the late Andrew Ross, “second only in importance to the
excellence of the glass through which it is seen.” To ensure
good illumination the mirror should be in direct co-ordination with
the objective and eye-piece; it must be regarded as a part of the
same system, and tending by a combined series of acts to a perfect
result. Illumination of the object is recognised as of three kinds
or qualities&mdash;reflected, transmitted, and refracted light. For the
illumination of transparent objects, transmitted light is brought
into use; for opaque objects, reflected light is needed.</p>

<p>The mirror should be about 2&frac12; or 3 inches in diameter, and it
must not be fixed, but made to slide up and down the stem under
the stage, so that the rays of light emanating from it may be
brought to a focus. The utility of the mirror is so obvious that
it is occasionally passed over in silence by writers. To myself it
appears to be an important accessory of the microscope, and I shall
therefore proceed to combine theory with practice in what I have to
say with regard to the mirror.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_152" src="images/fig_152.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 152.&mdash;Principal Focus of Mirror.</p></div>

<p>The microscope mirror should be the segment of a true sphere,
and its centre that of a true curvature. If the mirror has a true
circular boundary, the central point on line A (<a href="#fig_152">Fig. 152</a>) of the
reflecting surface, is the pole of the same. The line A C is known
as its principal axis, and any other straight line through C, which
meets the mirror, is its secondary axis. When the incident axis is
perfectly parallel to the principal axis, the reflected rays converge to
a point F, its principal focus. So much for the theory of the mirror.
Now we come to its practical use.</p>

<p>Simple as the mirror of the microscope may appear to be, if the
curve of the surface is not perfect, it will yield a secondary reflection
or double pencil of rays. The plane mirror will occasionally be
found to emit more than one reflection of the lamp-flame; this we
find may be corrected by rotating the mirror in its cell. Many years
ago I proposed to meet a difficulty of the kind by arranging a
rectangular prism on a separate stand, shown in <a href="#fig_153">Fig. 153</a>, consisting
of a prism A B, mounted in gimbal C, D, and E, secured to a brass
tube G, fitted to the stem, and thus made to take the place of the
mirror.</p>

<p>The direct method of employing the mirror, that more generally
resorted to, is by reflecting rays from the concave surface; the plane
surface is preferred when the condenser is used. Whichever is
employed, it should not be forgotten that the <i>optic axis</i> must be
preserved throughout, and so brought to the centre of the open tube
of the microscope. Another method is to interpose a bull’s-eye lens,
and in this way supply the mirror with a beam of parallel rays of
light. The plane side of the bull’s-eye lens should be turned towards
the lamp, so that lamp, bull’s-eye, sub-stage condenser, and objective,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
are brought into an exact line, the bull’s-eye being set at right-angles
to the line. A piece of thin white paper held across the bottom of
the sub-stage will serve to show whether the rays of light are fairly
parallel. The next care is to focus the object on the stage, and then
the sub-stage condenser on the slide; further correction should be
made by means of the centring screws of the sub-stage, or by moving
the bull’s-eye lens or lamp slightly, thus perfecting the arrangements
for working with parallel rays of light.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 153.&mdash;Rectangular Prism.</p></div>

<h3>Accessories of the Microscope.</h3>

<p>The accessories and appliances of the microscope have become so
very numerous, that any attempt to describe them and explain the
uses to which they are put would demand more space than I find
myself in a position to bestow upon them. I must therefore confine
my remarks to those accessories in more general use.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_154" src="images/fig_154.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 154.&mdash;The Lieberk&uuml;hn.</p></div>

<p>Having described the method of employing transmitted light, I
have a few words to add with regard to the illumination of opaque
objects by reflected light. A very early and efficient form of opaque
illumination is the well-known <i>Lieberk&uuml;hn</i>. This has not been
entirely surpassed by more recent inventions. The concave speculum
termed a Lieberk&uuml;hn, so named after its celebrated inventor, directly
reflects down upon the object the light received either from the mirror
or bull’s-eye lens. It consists of a silver cap, which slides over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
objective (<a href="#fig_154">Fig. 154</a>), <i>a</i> indicating the lower part of the compound body,
and <i>b</i> the objective over which slides the Lieberk&uuml;hn, <i>c</i>; the rays of
light are collected to a focus upon the object at <i>d</i>. The object may
either be mounted on a slip of glass, or
held by the stage-forceps, <i>f</i>; if very small,
or transparent, it may be gummed to the
dark well, <i>e</i>, or mounted on a Beck’s
opaque disc-revolver.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_155" src="images/fig_155.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 155.&mdash;Stage Forceps, for holding objects while under examination.</p></div>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_156" src="images/fig_156.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 156.&mdash;Beck’s Disc-holder.</p></div>

<p>This holder will be found useful for
the examination of opaque or other objects
that cannot be conveniently held by the
stage forceps, the specimen being temporarily
attached to it by gum or gold
size. The holder is intended to rotate, so
that every portion of the object can be
brought into view. In this way it will
be found useful in the study of insects, foraminifera, &amp;c.</p>

<p>With the Lieberk&uuml;hn, however, the illumination of opaque objects
must be more or less one-sided, and therefore, the silver side-reflector
has superseded it for general use (<a href="#fig_157">Fig. 157</a>). To ensure a more
perfect illumination of the object, the bull’s-eye lens should also be
used. Mr. Sorby devised a reflector to fit over the objective. It
consists of a semi-circular cap;
is, in short, a modification of
the parabolic reflector. The
light from the mirror can, by
slightly varying its inclination,
be brought into use with this
reflector.</p>

<p>The silver side-reflector is usually made with a ball-and-socket
joint, so that it can be turned in any direction. It is secured to the
stage of the microscope by the pin, which drops into a hole purposely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
drilled to receive it, and facility given for turning up and down,
or in any position. If daylight is used the microscope should be
placed in such a position that the light from a white cloud falls upon
the speculum, but the light of the lamp is far more manageable for
use with the reflector.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_157" src="images/fig_157.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 157.&mdash;Silver Side-reflector.</p></div>

<p>The Lieberk&uuml;hn is only intended to be used with low powers&mdash;a
2-inch, &frac12;-inch and a <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>-inch. Such objects as the elytra of the diamond
and other beetles are well suited for examination.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_158" src="images/fig_158.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 158.&mdash;Sorby’s Modification
of the Parabolic Reflector.</p></div>

<p>While experimenting with a parabolic reflector (<a href="#fig_158">Fig. 158</a>),
Mr. Sorby saw the value of examining objects under every kind of
illumination. As on viewing specimens of iron and steel with this
reflector he found that, from the great
obliquity of the illumination obtained,
the more brilliantly polished parts of
the specimen reflected the light beyond
the aperture of the objective, and these
could not be distinguished from those
parts which absorbed light, he thereupon
proceeded to place a small flat mirror in front of the objective,
and cover half its aperture, and at the same time stop off by means
of a semi-cylindrical tube the light from the parabolic reflector. This
arrangement produced the reverse appearance of that first employed,
and it proved to be a useful aid in determining structure.</p>

<h3>The Bull’s-eye Condensing Lens.</h3>

<p>This accessory is brought into constant use for the purpose of
converging rays from a lamp or mirror; or, for reducing the diverging
rays of the lamp to parallelism with the parabolic illuminator, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
silver side-reflector. The form in use is a plano-convex lens of about
three or four inches in focal length (<a href="#fig_159">Fig. 159</a>). It is usually mounted
on a brass stand, so that it may be placed and turned in any direction,
and at any height. When used by daylight, its plane side should be
turned towards the object, and the same position maintained when
used for converging the rays of light from the lamp; but when used
with the side-reflector the plane side must be towards the lamp.
Much attention has been paid to this very necessary accessory, the
bull’s-eye lens. A doublet has been brought into use which has
increased the value of the bull’s-eye condenser in bacteriological
research, and in micro-photography generally.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_159" src="images/fig_159.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 159.&mdash;Bull’s-eye Lens.</p></div>

<p>“During a recent investigation of the spherical aberration in
doublets, it was believed to be impossible to construct a doublet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
of the form known as ‘Herschel’s doublet’ free from aberration,
although these doublets figure in many books on optics. In a
condenser made by Baker the aberration is reduced to a minimum,
27 per cent. less than Sir John Herschel’s. This doublet, it
appears, differs from Herschel’s both in the ratio of the radii of
the meniscus, and also in the ratio of the foci of the two lenses;
indeed, the only point of similarity is in the first lens, which is
crossed. To test this, project the image of the flat lamp-flame
on a piece of white card with a plano-convex lens (the field-lens
of the Huyghenian eye-piece), use first the convex side and then
the plane side towards the card, the lamp being placed about
6 feet from the lens. Focus the lamp-flame as sharply as possible,
and a circular halo of misty light will be seen to surround the lamp-flame;
but when the plane side of the lens is made to face the card
this halo of misty light will be seen to be greatly reduced, and the
brightness of the image of the flame proportionately increased. If
the lens, then, were strictly aplanatic there should be no misty halo,
all the light being concentrated in the image of the lamp-flame, and
the image of maximum brightness. In short, the diameter of the halo
or misty light is the measure of the spherical aberration. If the
condenser referred to above, having the form of minimum aberration
for two planes, be compared in the same manner with an ordinary
single bull’s-eye of the same focus, the diameter of the misty halo
will be found reduced to a radius of about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>5</sub>-inch, but, with this
new condenser there is a further reduction, so that the radius of the
misty halo measures only <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>20</sub>-inch. These experiments are instructive,
because the brightness, or the mistiness of the microscopical image
is an associated phenomenon.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>A sectional view of the optical arrangement of Baker’s aplanatic
bull’s-eye doublet is shown, together with lamp, in <a href="#fig_148">Fig. 148</a>.</p>

<p><i>The Microscope Lamp.</i>&mdash;The introduction of paraffin into household
use has somewhat modified our views with regard to the most
suitable artificial source of illumination. Good paraffin burns with
a whiter and purer flame than colza oil, and consequently is less
liable to fatigue the eyes. The first cost of the lamp is trifling;
for a moderate sum a handy form of lamp can be had, mounted
on an adjustable sliding ring stand, and with a porcelain, metal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
or paper shade, to protect the eyes from scattered rays of light.
All opticians supply accepted forms of lamps.</p>

<p>To give the increased effect of whiteness to the light (“white
cloud illumination” as it is termed), take a piece of tissue paper,
dip it into a hot bath of spermaceti, and, when nearly cold, cut
out a circular piece and secure it over the largest opening in the
diaphragm plate. This will be found to materially moderate and
soften the light.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_160" src="images/fig_160.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 160.&mdash;Beck’s Complete Lamp.</p></div>

<p><i>Beck’s Complete Lamp</i> is constructed especially for delicate microscopical
work. It has a burner giving a flat flame; this can
be rotated to enable the edge or the flat of the flame to be used;
likewise a metal chimney with two apertures, in which 3 &times; 1 glass
slips slide; either white or coloured glasses may be used. A
Herschel aplanatic condenser is carried on a swinging arm, which
rotates around the lamp flame as a centre, and can be clamped in
any position. The whole lamp has a raising and lowering motion,
with a spring clamp to hold it in any position. The lamp is so
designed that at its lowest position the flame is only three inches
from the table. Here the microscopist is furnished with a lamp
which will accomplish all he may require with regard to illumination.

<p>Watson’s lamp (<a href="#fig_161">Fig. 161</a>) has a metal chimney, and is somewhat
simpler in structure than those already referred to. For the
student, the simpler and cheaper
form will answer every purpose. A
glass holder for carrying various
tinted slips of coloured glass to
act as a screen or modifier of
the light is much employed, and
assists in determining fine structures
(<a href="#fig_162">Fig. 162</a>).</p>

<h3>Nose-pieces and Objective Changers.</h3>

<p>A convenient appendage to the microscope is the rotating nose-piece,
invented by Mr. Charles Brooke, F.R.S., and intended to carry
two or more objectives, whereby a saving of time is effected, and
the trouble of repeatedly screwing and unscrewing is avoided. In
the application of the nose-piece attention should be given to
centring. Messrs. Baker’s objective changer is intended to facilitate
the placing and replacing the nose-piece in position. This adaptation
consists of a milled head, acting on three jaws, having a universal
screw thread, a decided improvement on the screw. Zeiss has adopted
a tube-sliding objective changer with centring adjustments. Messrs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
Watson met the difficulty of centring by making the nose-piece a
part of the body-tube of their microscopes (<a href="#fig_163">Fig. 163</a>). This, when
adapted to the shorter body of the students’ microscope, fully
compensates for want of length.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_163" src="images/fig_163.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 163.&mdash;Watson’s Centring
Nose-piece of Microscope.</p></div>

<p>Their triple nose-piece is constructed with much care, and when
in use is found very effective. It is manufactured of that very
light metal aluminium, and which
minimises the strain produced by the
heavier brass nose-piece.</p>

<p><i>Finders.</i>&mdash;The finder affords a
necessary and useful means of registering
the position of any particular
object, so that it may be readily found
again at any subsequent period. In
the work of examination the finder will save time when making a
special research, extending over a considerable surface.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_164" src="images/fig_164.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 164.&mdash;Triple Nose-pieces.</p></div>

<p>That the finder has been of use may be surmised from the number
invented and figured in the “Journal of the Royal Microscopical
Society.” By far the most useful form
is that of graduating the plates of the
mechanical stage, dividing a certain
portion into 100 parts. Powell and
Lealand have adopted this system in
their No. 1 stands, while Baker and
Watson have added a graduated
scale on silver to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub>th mm. as a
finder, and also a stage micrometer
in <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>th and <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub>th of a millimetre,
together with a Maltwood finder for
lodging the position of any desired
portion of a specimen under examination.</p>

<p>The <i>Maltwood</i> finder (<a href="#fig_165">Fig. 165</a>) can be used with any microscope,
and without a mechanical stage. This useful finder continues to
occupy a permanent place among the accessories of the microscope.
It consists of a glass slide, 3 &times; 1&frac14; inches, on which is photographed
a scale occupying a square inch; this is divided by horizontal and
vertical lines into 2,500 squares, each of which contains two numbers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
marking its “latitude,” or place in the vertical series, and its “longitude,”
or place in the horizontal series. The scale is in each instance
an exact distance from the bottom and left-hand end of the glass slide;
and the slide, when in use, should rest
upon the ledge of the stage of the
microscope, and be made to abut
against a stop, a simple pin, about an
inch and a half from the centre of the
stage.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_165" src="images/fig_165.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 165.&mdash;Maltwood’s Finder.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Pantacsek’s finder appears to
have some advantage over Maltwood’s, but it cannot be used with
the same facility, and therefore will not displace an old favourite.
<i>The Amyot</i> finder I have long had in use; it is efficient and inexpensive&mdash;can
indeed, if misplaced or lost, be replaced by the aid of
the square and compasses.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_166" src="images/fig_166.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 166.&mdash;Amyot’s Object Finder.</p></div>

<p><i>The Okeden</i> finder consists of two graduated scales, one <i>vertical</i>,
attached to the fixed stage-plate, the other <i>horizontal</i>, attached to an
arm carried by the intermediate plate; the first of these scales
enables the worker to “set” the vertically-sliding plate to any
determinate position in relation to the fixed plate, while the second
gives the power of setting the horizontally-sliding plate by that of
the intermediate.</p>

<p><i>Micrometers.</i>&mdash;It is of the utmost importance to have a means
of measuring with accuracy the objects, or part of objects, under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
observation. The most efficient piece of apparatus for the purpose
is the micrometer eye-piece, the earlier form of which, Jackson’s, has
been described under the heading <i>Eye-pieces</i> (p. 144). In the case of
micrometers, as in that of most other accessories, every optician has
his own adaptation and method of employing the same.</p>

<p>For the measurement of bacteria, a stage micrometer should be
used with a camera lucida. The stage micrometer consists of a slip
of thin glass ruled with a scale consisting of tenths and hundredths
of a millimetre. The image is
projected on to a piece of paper
placed on the table, and the
drawing made, and the object
to be measured can be readily
compared with the scale.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_167" src="images/fig_167.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 167.&mdash;The Ramsden Micrometer
Eye-piece.</p></div>

<p>In the Ramsden micrometer
eye-piece, as previously explained,
two fine wires are
stretched across the field of
an eye-piece, one of which can
be moved by a micrometer
screw. In the field there is
also a scale with teeth, and
the interval between them corresponds to that of the threads of
the screw.</p>

<p>The circumference of the brass head is usually divided into one
hundred parts, and a screw with one hundred threads to the inch is
used. The bacterium to be measured is brought into a position in
which an edge appears to be in contact with the fixed wire, and the
micrometer screw is turned until the travelling wire appears to be
in contact with the other edge. The scale in the field and scale
on the milled head, together, give the number of complete turns
of the screw and the value of a fraction of a turn in separating
the wires.</p>

<p>In the micrometer eye-piece constructed by Zeiss, the eye-piece
with a glass plate with crossed lines is carried across the field by
means of a micrometer screw. Each division on the edge of a drum
corresponds to ·01 mm. Complete revolutions of the drum are
counted by means of a figured scale in the visual field.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

<p>In the micrometer used with Zeiss’s <i>apochromatic</i> objectives and
compensating eye-pieces the divisions are so computed, that, with
a tube-length of 160 mm., the value of one interval represents, with
each objective, just as many micra (·0001 mm.) as there are millimetres
in its focal length. A value of tables is therefore not required
for these eye-pieces, since the focus of the lenses indicates their
micrometer values within 5 per cent.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_168" src="images/fig_168.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 168.&mdash;The Wollaston Camera Lucida.</p></div>

<p>The <i>Camera Lucida</i> will prove an extremely useful adjunct to the
micrometer, and a large number of contrivances have been devised
for its employment. There are those which project the image on to
the surface of a sheet of paper provided for the drawing, and those
which project the pencil and paper into the field of the microscope.
The former method is that usually adopted. To draw an object,
with either a Wollaston camera lucida or a neutral tint reflector,
such as that of Beale’s, both of which are made to slide on and take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
the place of the cap of the eye-piece, as shown in <a href="#fig_168">Fig. 168</a>, with its
flat side uppermost, the whole instrument must be raised until the
edge of the prism is exactly 10 inches from a piece of paper placed upon
the table; with the latter the instrument retains its vertical position,
and the image of the object is thrown on the paper placed in front of
the stand. The light must be so regulated that no more than is
really necessary is upon the object, whilst a full light should be
thrown upon the paper. Only one eye is to be used; and if one half
of the pupil be directed over the edge of the prism, the object will
appear upon the paper, and can be traced on it by a pencil, the point
of which will also be seen. Should any blueness be visible in the
field, the prism is pushed too far on, and should be drawn back
till the colour disappears.</p>

<p>Beale’s neutral tint reflector (<a href="#fig_170">Fig. 170</a>) is much in use, and its
advantages are utility, simplicity, and inexpensiveness.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_171" src="images/fig_171.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 171.&mdash;The Abbe Model Camera Lucida.</p></div>

<p>The Abbe model of camera lucida has been brought into use
because the projected image can be better illuminated, and is consequently
so much brighter. This form is now made in aluminium
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
by Messrs. Watson &amp; Sons. In place of the image being traced by
projection on paper, the reverse is the case, both the paper and pencil
are projected into the field of view. The mirror reflects the paper on
to the silvered surface of a prism placed over the eye-lens of the eye-piece
of the microscope, and it is thereby
conveyed to the eye. There is a central
opening in the silvering through which
microscopic vision is obtained. It is
fitted in a new manner by means of a
cloth-lined adapter, fitting over the outside
of the microscope tube; this saves
all trouble in centring and ensures concentricity.
Where the instrument has
capped eye-pieces, the camera lucida
must be adapted to the eye-piece, the
cap being removed. The apparatus can be disconnected from the
fitting adapter by means of a sliding pin, and readily replaced, or
can be lifted over out of the way, as shown in the drawing. Being
made almost entirely in aluminium it is very much lighter than
other forms of apparatus, and does not cause vibration. It can be
used with the microscope <i>at any angle</i>, the only necessity being that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
the paper on which the sketch is made should be kept at the same
angle as the instrument.</p>

<h3>Micro-Photography.</h3>

<p>Micro-photography or photo-micrography, as it is indifferently
termed, has, to a very considerable extent, superseded the use of
the camera lucida for the delineation of images seen under the
microscope. I may claim to be among the first workers with the
microscope (1841) to prove beyond a doubt that the camera could
be made to render invaluable aid to the microscopist, whereby a
great saving of time might be effected, and a drawing obtained with
greater accuracy than that of the pencil of the draughtsman.</p>

<p>It was about 1864-5 that Dr. Woodward’s earlier micro-photographs
were first seen in London. His skill in the manipulation of
the microscope had been long known. His first series of photographs
of test diatoms created, I remember, quite a sensation; they have
probably never been surpassed. These were taken by sun-light,
magnesium, and electric-light. I was the recipient of a series taken
at a later date (1870), and which, bound in quarto volume, are
almost as perfect in definition as any of a later date taken by oil-immersion
objectives.</p>

<p>The objectives used by Dr. Woodward, throughout, were a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>-inch
of Wales’s (new series), and a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub>-inch immersion, of Powell &amp;
Lealand’s, especially produced for work with the camera. The
magnification varied from 800 to 3,000 diameters, a frustule of
<i>Grammatophora Marina</i> magnified 2,500, and a scale of podura,
marked 3,000 in my collection, are equal in definition to those taken
by a high-angle <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch oil-immersion. Pathological specimens
taken with lower powers are equally instructive, a section of
epithelial cancer showing both nuclei and cells with distinctness.</p>

<p>Dr. Maddox in 1864 was also experimentally engaged in the
improvement of the processes of photography for the purpose of
promoting the work of microscopists. His labours were attended
with great success. To him we are indebted for the gelatine dry-plate
process, which gave a remarkable impetus to photography
in general. Dr. Maddox has, for a period extending over forty
years, diligently and successfully cultivated and promoted micro-photography.
Among other workers to whom we are indebted for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
improvements in micro-photography I may mention Wenham, Draper,
Shadbolt, Highley, Koch, Sternberg, Pringle, Leitz, and Pfeiffer.</p>

<p>Dr. Koch justly claims the credit of having extended the application
of micro-photography to the delineation of bacteria. A series
of instructive micro-photographs were published by him in 1877.</p>

<p>The importance of the camera has become more manifest as the
work of the bacteriologist has progressed. Koch strongly advocated
micro-photography on the ground that illustrations, especially of
bacteria, should be as true to nature as possible. Dr. Edgar
Crookshank holds the same opinion, and in support of his views we
have numerous illustrations of the bacteria given in his valuable
“Text-book of Bacteriology.” But he does not disguise the truth that
there are difficulties to be encountered, the first of which is owing
to the fact that the smallest and most interesting bacteria can only
be made visible in animal tissues by <i>staining</i>. This drawback has
been very nearly overcome by the use of eosin-collodion. With this
medium, and by shutting off portions of the spectrum by coloured
glasses, Koch succeeded in obtaining photographs of bacteria, which
were stained with blue and red aniline dyes. This method, however,
introduced a disturbing element of another kind. Owing to the
longer exposure required, the results were wanting in definition,
attributable, it was thought, to vibrations of the apparatus produced
by passing traffic, or by assistants moving about over the
floor of the laboratory.</p>

<p>Koch nevertheless showed, at the great meeting of the International
Medical Association in London, 1881, a series of micro-photographs
of bacteria and tissue sections, which were the admiration
of all who saw them. To meet a difficulty occasioned by the aniline
dyes, Koch recommended that the preparations should be stained
brown; other experimenters found that preparations stained either
yellow or yellowish-brown gave good photographic representations;
but it is by no means an easy matter to find a good differential
stain of bacteria in the tissues, as even Bismarck brown is not
entirely successful. Other bacteriologists have encountered similar
difficulties at the outset. Hauser succeeded in showing the value
of micro-photography in the production of pictures of <i>impression</i>
preparations and colonies of bacteria in nutrient-gelatine. But to
give the general effect, as well as faithfully reproduce the minute
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
details in these preparations of bacteria by the aid of the pencil,
would in most cases create insurmountable difficulties, except in the
hand of the most accomplished draughtsman. Hauser employed
Gerlach’s apparatus, and Schleusser’s dry-plates, and obtained his
illumination by means of a small incandescent lamp, which gave
a strong white light. The preparations so photographed were for
the most part stained brown, and mounted in the ordinary way in
Canada balsam.</p>

<p>In 1884, Van Ermengen succeeded in photographing preparations
of comma-bacilli stained with fuchsine and methyl violet. These
pictures afforded the first practical illustration of the value of iso-chromatic
plates in micro-photography, and their introduction marks
a distinct era in the progress of micro-photography. The iso-chromatic,
or more properly the ortho-chromatic, dry-plate process
was introduced because in photography blue or violet comes out
almost or quite white, while other colours, yellow and red, are
represented by a sombre shade or even by black. This is due to
the want of equality of strength between the luminous and the
actinic or chemical rays of light. In other words, the violet and
blue rays are more chemically active than any other portion of the
spectrum. It was found, then, that if plates were coloured yellow
with turmeric, the blue and violet rays were intercepted, and their
actinism proportionately reduced.</p>

<p>“In 1881, the so-called iso-chromatic plates were introduced.
The emulsion of bromide of silver and gelatine was stained with
eosin, and it was claimed that colours could be represented with
their relative intensity; chlorophyll and other stains have also been
tried, and by such methods the ordinary gelatine dry-plates can be so
treated that they will reproduce various colours, according to their
relative light intensity, and thus be rendered <i>iso</i>-, or what is now
known as ortho-chromatic.”</p>

<h3>Apparatus and Material.</h3>

<p><i>Apparatus and Material</i> used in micro-photography have, from time
to time, been greatly varied by different workers, some preferring to
use the microscope in the vertical position with the camera superimposed
or fitted on the eye-piece of the microscope tube; others,
again, prefer that both the microscope and the camera should be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
arrayed horizontally. In another form the ordinary microscope is
dispensed with and the objective stage and mirror are adapted to
the front of the camera, together with a suitable arrangement for
holding the object. Lastly, the camera is lain aside, and an operating-room
rendered impervious to light, takes its place, and the image is
projected and focussed upon a ground glass screen held in its place
by a separate support. This method has been made practical since
the introduction into microscopy by Zeiss of the <i>projection</i> eye-piece.
It is well known that micro-photographs can be produced by
employing these projection eye-pieces, as well as for screen illustrations
in the lecture-room.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_172" src="images/fig_172.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 172.&mdash;Swift’s Horizontal Apparatus.</p></div>

<p>With regard to the position of the microscope and camera, the
horizontal affords greater stability than the vertical, and is on this
account to be preferred. The simplest apparatus consists of a camera
fixed upon a base board, four or five feet in length, upon which the
microscope can be clamped, and which also carries the lamp and
bull’s-eye lens (<a href="#fig_172">Fig. 172</a>). This arrangement I have found economical
and useful. No more elaborate arrangement is actually necessary.
Sunlight is no doubt the best, but a good paraffin lamp is a handy
and available illuminant.</p>

<p>With the former, and rapid plates, a short exposure of three or
four seconds, even when high powers are used, is found sufficient;
whereas, with the paraffin lamp it will vary from three to ten minutes.</p>

<p>Walmsley gives the following table for exposures with the lamp:&mdash;</p>

<p>For micro-photography the following practical rules must be
observed. The sub-stage condenser may be dispensed with when low
powers are used, as well as the mirror, and the lamp so placed that
the image of the flat of the flame appears accurately adjusted in the
centre of the field of the microscope. The bull’s-eye lens is so
interposed, that the image of the flame disappears, and the whole
field becomes equally illuminated with high powers; the sub-stage
achromatic condenser must be used, and a greater intensity of
illumination is obtained by placing the lamp-flame edgeways. It is
advisable to begin the practice of micro-photography with low powers,
and a trial experiment should be made with some well-known object
as the blow-fly’s tongue.</p>

<p>Dr. Crookshank is of opinion that, in the case of micro-organisms
when their biological characters are studied under low powers of the
microscope, photographs are preferable, because they give a more
faithful representation of the object. A micro-organism, even under
the highest powers of the microscope, is so minute an object, that to
represent it in a drawing requires a very delicate touch, and it is only
too easy to make a <i>picture</i> which gives an erroneous impression to
those who have not seen the original. Photography enables the
scientific worker to record rapid changes, and it is quite possible as
the art advances we may find the film more sensitive than the
human retina, and that it will bring out details in bacteria which
would be otherwise unrecognised. The result, therefore, of experience
is that in research laboratories it will come into more general use as a
faithful and graphic method. I cannot better bring these observations
to a close than by giving a quotation from Dr. Piersoll’s practical
method of obtaining micro-photographs.</p>

<p>The three essential conditions to ensure success in micro-photography
are:&mdash;(1) Satisfactory apparatus; (2) good illumination; (3)
suitable preparations. With high amplifications (1,000 diameters
and over), the conditions are greatly changed by the approach to
the limit both of the shortness of the focus of the objective and
of the length of the camera which can be advantageously used; for
the first experience leads to the adoption of the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch, for the
second four feet is the limit, since a given high amplification, say
2,000 diameters, can be more satisfactorily and more conveniently
obtained with a superior <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch connection with suitable optical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
means to increase the initial magnifying power of the objective,
than with an unaided <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>25</sub>-inch lens, and the plate removed to
a greater distance. Until quite recently the various amplifiers
offered the best means of increasing the power of an objective,
but the introduction of the <i>projection-oculars</i> of Zeiss is an accessory
piece of apparatus, far superior to any older device. These
projection-oculars resemble ordinary microscopical oculars or eye-pieces
only in general form and name, being optically a projection-objective
in connection with a collecting lens. The new
oil-immersion apochromatic lenses, in combination with these
projection-oculars, form undoubtedly the more efficient equipment
for high-power work; it is as true for high-power photography as
for microscopical observation in general, that the best results are
obtained with fine and necessarily expensive, optical appliances.
If for the satisfactory study of the intimate structure of a cell,
or of a micro-organism, the most improved immersion lenses are
necessary, it is to be expected that, for the successful photography
of the same, tools at least as good are needed. Sunlight
certainly affords the most satisfactory illumination whereby good
micro-photographs can be obtained, as well as for recording microscopical
images. That by good lamp-light fair impressions of objects
under extreme magnification can be secured is encouraging, but the
negatives produced by such illumination seldom, if ever, possess
the characteristics of a really good sunlight negative, where the
sharpest details are combined with an exquisite softness and
harmony of half-tones.</p>

<p>If the mirror of the microscope be of good size, it will only be
necessary to make an arm on which to support the removed mirror
outside some southerly exposed window, since it is desirable to have
a greater distance between the mirror and the stage than would be
possible were the mirror attached in its usual place. Where the
microscope mirror is too small to be satisfactorily used, a rectangular
wood-framed looking-glass is readily mounted, with the aid of a few
strips of wood, so as to turn about both axes.</p>

<p>The rays from the plane side of the mirror should pass through a
condensing lens (of 8-10-inch focus, if possible), so placed that they
are brought to a focus before reaching the plane of the object. The
exact position of the condensing lens is a matter of experience;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
usually, however, the most favourable illumination is obtained at
that point where the field is brilliantly and <i>uniformly</i> illuminated,
just before the rays form the image source of light; the nearer
the focus the less disturbance from diffraction rings. Ordinary
objectives will require the employment of monochromatic light&mdash;produced
either by a deep blue solution of ammonia-sulphate of
copper, or by the green glass screen&mdash;since the optical and actinic
foci do not usually perfectly coincide. Powers up to the &frac34;-inch will
require no further condenser; with the &frac14; or <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub>-inch objectives, the
low power (1 or &frac34;-inch) serves with advantage as an achromatic
condenser, when attached to the sub-stage. The Abbe condenser,
although so important for fine microscopical investigation, is not
adapted to photography unless a very wide cone of light is desired,
which, for the majority of preparations, is some advantage; a low-power
objective, used as a condenser, is found to be more satisfactory
than the Abbe with a small diaphragm.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>The greatest delicacy in manipulation is necessary, as in working
with a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch objective a turn too much of the fine adjustment will
cause the image to vanish. With fine preparations of bacteria it is
not easy to trace the image, and hence the advantage of commencing
with a well-marked object, as that of the fly’s tongue. The development
and fixation of the image must be proceeded with as in the
ordinary photographic process. In the text-books of photography
full accounts of failures will be found, their causes and prevention.
Numerous papers and suggestions for micro-photographic work will
also be found scattered throughout the “Journal of the Royal
Microscopical Society.”</p>

<p>The <i>Projection Eye-piece</i> has become an essential part of micro-photography,
and it is so arranged that it may be employed with
advantage with objectives of either the apochromatic or ordinary
series for photographic purposes, projecting an exquisitely sharp
image of the object on the plate. A diaphragm between the lenses
limits the field, and a sharp image of it should appear on the screen
when the eye-piece is adjusted. The adjustment may be effected by
revolving the eye-piece cap in a spiral slot, so that the eye or top
lens is either brought closer or removed farther away from the
diaphragm, as may be required, and divisions and a reader are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
usually provided for registering positions. Such eye-pieces are made
to fit any size microscope body.</p>

Vertical Micro-photographic
Apparatus.</p></div>

<p>The microscope and camera (<a href="#fig_173">Fig. 173</a>) are here seen to be
part of the same instrument. The bellows of the camera have an
extension varying from 6 in. to 30 in.
The board on which the microscope
and limelight jet are fixed is made to
turn out of the line of the camera to
facilitate adjusting the instrument and
radiant, either limelight, electric light
or paraffin lamp; when this is done
the board carrying the same is turned
back to a stop which brings the microscope
into a central position with the
focussing screen. An adjustment is
supplied at the side of the camera,
geared to the slow movement, for finely
focussing the object upon the screen.
A light-excluding connection is fitted
to the front of the camera and microscope;
immediately behind this, in the
bellows, is an exposing shutter which
is manipulated by means of a small
milled head. Two focussing screens
are usually supplied, one grey, and one
patent plate, together with a double
dark slide.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrew Pringle’s vertical micro-photographic
apparatus is an excellent
form; it consists of a heavy base and
brass support, carrying a quarter-plate
camera, grey and plain glass focussing
screen, double dark back, camera extending to 24 inches, and
turning aside as shown in Fig 173. It is light-tight in all its
connections.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span></p>

<p>To secure uniform results in micro-photography, only thin preparations,
which lie as nearly as possible in one plane, can be relied
upon for good and perfect negatives.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 174.&mdash;Ross’s Arc Lamp.</p></div>

<p>An electric arc lamp specially designed for micro-photographic
work, wherever the electric current is available, is that known as
“the Ross-Hepworth projection arc lamp.” The advantage gained
by this form of lamp is not only on account of the ease with which
it may be employed, but also on account of its superior power and
quality. It is of primary importance that the lamp employed to
convert the electricity into light should be of a good and reliable
pattern. It is not essential that
it should be automatic in its
working&mdash;many experienced micro-photographers
preferring a simple
hand-feed lamp to the one of a
more complicated kind, being so
much less difficult to keep in order.
A good hand-feed microscope-lamp
has the advantage of greater simplicity
and portability.</p>

<p>The argand gas-light arranged
for me many years ago for micro-photography
may be employed
with advantage. It is clean, and
always ready for use when brought
down to the table attached by a piece of india-rubber tubing. The
incandescent form of burner enhances its value, since the light is
thereby rendered whiter. The arrangement is shown in the diagrammatic
drawing, <a href="#fig_175">Fig. 175</a>.</p>

<p>Over the argand burner B, is a pale-blue glass chimney, resting
on a wire gauze, stage A; this secures a uniform current of air. The
colour of the flame may be still more influenced by a disc of neutral
tint, or other coloured glass, inserted into the circular opening at E,
in a half-cylinder of metal, G, used to cut off all extraneous light;
can be rotated on the stage by the ivory nob at H, a metallic
reflector I, attached to the standard rod, on being brought parallel
to F serves to concentrate the light and send it on to the bull’s-eye, and
through it to the mirror, or directly to the photo-microscopic camera.

<p>By removing the shield G, and bringing the shade M over the
burner, it is at once converted into a useful microscopical lamp,
for all ordinary purposes. The screw R clamps the lamp-flame at
any height, while the support N carries a water-bath O, or a plate P,
both of which will be found useful in preparing and mounting
objects.</p>

<p>A special incandescent gas-lamp is made by Messrs. R. &amp; J. Beck.</p>

<h3>Polarisation of Light.</h3>

<p>Common light moves in two planes at right angles to each other,
while polarised light moves in one plane only. Common light may
be turned into polarised light either by transmission or reflection;
in the first instance, one of the planes of common light is got rid of
by reflection; in the other, by absorption. Huyghens was one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
the first physicists to notice that a ray of light has not the same
properties in every part of its circumference, and he compared it to
a magnet or a collection of magnets; and supposed that the minute
particles of which it was said to be composed had different poles,
which, when acted on in certain ways, arranged themselves in
particular positions; and thence the term <i>polarisation</i>, a term having
neither reference to cause nor effect. It is to Malus, however, who,
in 1808, discovered polarisation by reflection, that we are indebted
for the series of splendid phenomena which have since that period
been developed; phenomena of such surpassing beauty as to exceed
most ordinary objects presented to the eye under the microscope.</p>

<p>Certainly no more misleading name could well have been found to
describe the causation, in one particular direction, of small displacements
in the medium, through which the light waves are made to
pass.</p>

<p>The effect of “polarising” light is simply to alter the directions of
the vibrations of light, and allow of certain waves to pass which are
vibrating in one direction only, vertical, horizontal, or oblique, as
the case may be. The most efficient agent discovered for the
polarisation of light is that of Iceland spar, cut and mounted as a
“Nicol” prism.</p>

<p>By cutting crystals of Iceland spar into two parts, at a particular
angle, and cementing them together again in the reverse way, Nicol
succeeded in showing that one of the two polarising pencils could be
totally deflected to one side, while the other is directly transmitted
through the Nicol prism, and thereby the beam of light becomes at
once “polarised” in one plane only. No apparent difference can be
seen in the prism on holding it up to the light, except it be in a
very slight loss of brightness; but if another similarly heated crystal
be held before, and made to revolve around, a quarter of the circle
just where the two cross each other, total darkness results. This
phenomenon alternately recurs at every quadrature of the circle.
A pair of Nicol prisms, when appropriately mounted, constitute “a
polarising apparatus” for the microscope, one being fitted into the
sub-stage, and the other either immediately above the objective or
eye-piece, where it can be easily rotated, the object to be examined
being placed on the stage of the microscope, that is, between the
polarising and analysing prisms.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p></div>

<p>The significance of polarised light centres in the fact that it
affords a wider insight into the structure of crystals, minerals, and
a number of other substances, and which could not otherwise be
obtained without its aid. Its usefulness is multifold, as even glass
itself, when not properly annealed, exhibits points of fracture, by a
display of Newton’s rings. The knowledge thus acquired is turned
to account by glass manufacturers.</p>

<p><i>Double refraction.</i>&mdash;When an incident ray of light is refracted
into a crystal of any other than the cubic system, or into compressed
or <i>unannealed glass</i>, it gives rise to two refracted rays which take
different paths; this phenomenon is termed <i>double refraction</i>. Attention
was called to this in 1670, by Bartolin, who first observed it
in Iceland spar; and the laws for this substance were accurately
determined by Huyghens.</p>

<p>Iceland spar or calc spar is a form of crystallized carbonate of lime.
It is composed of fifty-six parts of lime and forty-four parts of
carbonic acid, and is usually found in rhombohedral forms of
crystallization.</p>

<p>To observe the phenomenon of double refraction, a rhomb of
Iceland spar may be laid on a page of a printed book, when all the
letters seen through it will appear double; the depth of the blackness
of the letters is seen to be considerably less than that of the
originals, except where the two images overlap.</p>

<p>In order to state the laws of the phenomena with precision, it is
necessary to attend to the crystalline form of Iceland spar, which
has equal obtuse angles. If a line be drawn through one of these
corners, making equal angles with the three edges which meet there,
it, or any line parallel to it, is called the <i>axis</i> of the crystal; the axis
being, properly speaking, not a definite <i>line</i> but a definite <i>direction</i>.</p>

<p>The angles of the crystals are the same in all specimens. If the
crystal is of such proportions that these three edges spoken of are
equal, as in the smaller crystal (<a href="#fig_176">Fig. 176</a>), the axis is the direction
of one of its diagonals, as represented.</p>

<p>Any plane containing (or parallel to) the axis is called the
<i>principal plane</i> of the crystal.</p>

<p>In the next diagram, <a href="#fig_177">Fig. 177</a>, the line appears double, as <i>a b</i>
and <i>c d</i>, or the dot, as <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>. Or allow a ray of light, <i>g h</i>, to fall
thus on the crystal, it will in its passage through be separated into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
two rays, <i>h f</i>, <i>h e</i>; and on coming to the opposite surface of the
crystal, will pass out at <i>e f</i> in the direction of <i>i k</i>, parallel to <i>g h</i>.
The plane <i>l m n o</i> is designated the principal section of the crystal,
and the line drawn from the solid angle <i>l</i> to the angle <i>o</i> is where
the axis of the crystal will be found; this is its optic axis. Now
when a ray of light passes along this axis, it is undivided, and there
is only one image; but in all other directions there are two images.</p>

of Rays of Light.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Nicol, of Edinburgh
first succeeded in making a
rhomb of Iceland spar into
a <i>single-image prism</i>. His
method of splitting up the
crystal into two equal parts
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>A rhomb of Iceland spar
of one-fourth of an inch in
length, and about four-eighths
of an inch in breadth
and thickness, is divided into
two equal portions in a plane,
passing through the acute lateral angle, and nearly touching the
obtuse side angle. The sectional plane of each of these halves must
be carefully polished, and the two portions cemented firmly together
with Canada balsam, so as to form a rhomb similar to that before
division; by this management the ordinary and extraordinary rays
are so separated that only one is transmitted: the cause of this great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
divergence of the rays is considered to be owing to the action of
the Canada balsam, the refractive index of which (1·549) is that
between the ordinary (1·6543) and the extraordinary (1·4833) refraction
of calcareous spar, and which will change the direction of both
rays in an opposite manner before they enter the posterior half of
the combination. The direction
of rays passing through such a
prism is indicated by the arrow,
<a href="#fig_178">Fig. 178</a>.</p>

<p>Polarised light cannot be distinguished
from common light, as
already said, by the naked eye; and for all experimental purposes
in polarisation, two pieces of apparatus must be employed, one to
produce polarisation, and the other to show or an analyse it. The former
is called the <i>polariser</i>, the latter the <i>analyser</i>; and every apparatus
that serves for one of these purposes will also serve for the other.</p>

<p>Polarising Apparatus for Students’ Microscope.</p>

<p>In all cases there are two positions, differing by 180&deg;, which give a
minimum of light, and the two positions intermediate between these
give a maximum of light. The extent of the changes thus observed
is a measure of the completeness of the polarisation of light.</p>

<p>The two prisms mounted as shown in Figs. 179 and 179<i>a</i>
constitute the apparatus adapted to the microscope. The polariser
slips into place below the stage, and the analyser, with the prism
fixed in a tube, is screwed in above the objective.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

<p>The definition is considered by some experimenters as somewhat
better if the analyser be used above the eye-piece, and is certainly
more easily rotated.</p>

small milled-head screw, the other prism  <a href="#fig_179">Fig. 179</a><i>a</i>)
is screwed on above the object-glass, and thus passes
directly into the body of the microscope. The light
from the mirror having been reflected through them
the axes of the two prisms must be made to coincide;
this is done by regulating the milled-head
screw until, by revolving the <i>polarising</i> prism, the
field of view is entirely darkened twice during its
revolution. If very minute salts or crystals are
submitted for examination then it will be found
preferable to place the analyser above the eye-piece,
as in <a href="#fig_180">Fig. 180</a>. Thus the <i>polariscope</i> is seen to
consist of two parts; one for <i>polarising</i>, the other
for <i>analysing</i> or testing the light. There is no
essential difference between the two parts, except what convenience
or economy may lead us to adopt; and either part, therefore, may
be used as polariser or analyser; but whichever is used as the
polariser, the other becomes the analyser.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 181.&mdash;More Modern Polariser and Analyser.</p></div>

<p>Opticians have their own methods of adapting the polariser and
analyser to their several microscopes. Watson’s special form of
apparatus is represented in <a href="#fig_181">Fig. 181</a>, the polariser being adapted to
the sub-stage, and the analyser to screw into the objective.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<p><i>Tourmaline.</i>&mdash;A semi-transparent mineral, of a neutral or bluish tint,
called tourmaline, when cut into thin slices (about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>20</sub>-inch thick)
with their faces parallel to their axes exhibit the same phenomena as
the Nicol prism. The only objection to which is that the transmitted
polarised beam is more or less coloured. The tourmaline to be
preferred stops the most light when its axis is at right-angles to that
of the polariser, and yet admits the most when in the same plane.
Make choice of a tourmaline as perfect as possible; size is of less
importance when intended for use with the microscope.</p>

<p>Transmission of rays through tourmaline is only one of several
ways in which light can be polarised. When a beam of light is
reflected from a polished surface of glass, wood, ivory, leather, or any
other non-metallic substance, at an angle of 50&deg; to 60&deg; with the
normal, it is more or less polarised, and in like manner a reflector
composed of any of these substances may be employed as an analyser.
In so using it, it should be rotated about an axis parallel to the
incident rays which are to be tested, and the observation consists in
noting whether this rotation produces changes in the amount of
reflected light.</p>

<p>For every reflected substance there is a particular angle of incidence,
which gives a maximum of polarisation in reflected light. It is
called the <i>polarising angle</i> for the substance, and its tangent is always
equal to the index of refraction of the substance; or, what amounts to
the same thing, it is that particular angle of incidence which is the
complement of the angle of refraction, so that the refracted rays are
at right angles. This important law was discovered experimentally
by Sir David Brewster.</p>

<p>Tourmaline, like Iceland spar, is a negative uniaxial crystal; and
its use as a polariser depends on the property which it possesses of
absorbing the ordinary much more rapidly than the extraordinary ray,
so that a thickness which is tolerably transparent to the latter is
almost completely opaque to the former. Its pale cobalt blue colour
enhances the beauty of certain crystal and mineral substances, but
like Iceland spar, the paler and more perfect crystals are becoming
scarce.</p>

<p><i>Selenite</i> is another mineral of value in polarisation experiments.
It is a native crystalline hydrated sulphate of lime. A beautiful
fibrous variety called <i>satin-gypsum</i> is found in Derbyshire. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
form of the crystal most frequently met with is that of an oblique
rectangular prism, with ten rhomboidal faces, two of which are much
larger than the rest. It is usually split up into thin lamin&aelig; parallel
to their lateral faces; each film should have a thickness of from one-twentieth
to one-sixtieth of an inch. In the two rectangular directions
these films allow perpendicular rays of polarised light to
traverse them unchanged, termed their <i>neutral axes</i>. In two other
directions, however, which form respectively angles of 45&deg; with the
neutral axes, these films have the property of double refraction, a
direction known as the <i>depolarising axis</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_182" src="images/fig_182.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 182.&mdash;Darker’s Selenite Films
and Stage.</p></div>

<p>The thickness of the film of selenite determines the particular tint.
If, therefore, we use a film of irregular thickness, different colours
are presented by the different
thicknesses. These facts admit
of very curious and beautiful
illustration, when used under the
object placed on the stage of the
microscope. The films employed
should be mounted between two
glasses for protection. Some
persons employ a large film,
mounted in this way between the
plates of glass, with a raised edge,
to act as a stage for supporting
the object, it is then called the “selenite stage.” The best film for
the microscope is that which gives blue, and its complementary
colour yellow. The late Mr. Darker constructed a selenite stage
for the purpose (<a href="#fig_182">Fig. 182</a>). With this a mixture of colours will be
brought about, by superimposing three films, one on the other. By
slight variations in their positions, produced by means of an endless-screw
motion, all the colours of the spectrum can be shown. When
objects are thus exhibited, it should be borne in mind that all
negative tints, as they are termed, are diminished, and all positive
tints increased; the effect of which is to mask the true character of
the phenomena.</p>

<p>For a certain thickness of selenite the ellipse will become a circle,
and we have thus what is called <i>circularly-polarised</i> light, which is
characterised by the property that rotation of the analyser produces
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
no change of intensity. Circularly-polarised light is not, however,
identical with ordinary light; for the interposition of an additional
thickness of selenite converts it into elliptically (or in a particular
case into plane) polarised light.</p>

<p>It is necessary, for the exhibition of colour in our experiments,
that the plate of selenite should be very thin, otherwise the retardation
of one component vibration as compared with the other will be
greater by several complete periods for violet than for red, so that
the ellipses will be identical for several different colours, and the
total non-suppressed light will be sensibly white in all positions of
the analyser.</p>

<p>Two thick plates may, however, be so combined as to produce the
effect of one thin plate. For example, two selenite plates of nearly
equal thickness may be laid one upon the other, so that the direction
of greatest elasticity in the one shall be parallel to that of least
elasticity in the other. The resultant effect in this case will be that
due to the difference of their thicknesses. Two plates so laid are
said to be <i>crossed</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_183" src="images/fig_183.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 183.&mdash;<i>Red</i> is represented by perpendicular lines; <i>Green</i> by oblique.</p></div>

<p>The following experiments will well serve to illustrate some of the
more striking phenomena of double refraction, and will also be a
useful introduction to its practical application. Take a plate of
brass (<a href="#fig_183">Fig. 183</a>) three inches by one, perforated with a series of holes
from about one-sixteenth to one-fourth of an inch in diameter; the
size of the smallest should be in accordance with the power of the
objective, and the separating power of the double refraction.</p>

<p><i>Experiment</i> 1.&mdash;Place the brass plate so that the smallest hole
shall be in the centre of the stage of the microscope; employ a low
power (1&frac12; or 2 inches) objective, and adjust the focus as for the
ordinary microscopic object; place the double image prism over the
eye-piece, and two distinct images will be seen; by revolving the
prism, the images will describe a circle, the circumference of which
will cut the centre of the field of view; one of which is the ordinary,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
the other the extraordinary ray. By moving the slide from left to
right the larger orifices will appear in the field, the images seen will
not be completely separated, but will overlap, as represented in the
figure.</p>

<p><i>Experiment</i> 2.&mdash;Insert the Nicol’s prism into its place under the
stage, still retaining the double image prism over the eye-piece;
then, by examining the object, there will appear in some positions
two images, in others only one image; it will be seen, that at 90&deg;
this ray will be cut off, and that which was first observed will
become visible; at 180&deg;, or one-half the circle, an alternate change
will take place; at 270&deg;, another change; and at 360&deg;, the completion
of the circle, the first image will reappear.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to make the next experiment, the position of
the Nicol’s prism should be adjusted, and its angles brought parallel
with the square of the stage. The true relative position of the
selenite should also be determined by noticing the natural flaws in
the film, which should run parallel with each other, and be adjusted
at an angle of about 46&deg; with the square bars of the stage.</p>

<p><i>Experiment</i> 3.&mdash;If we now take the plate of selenite thus prepared,
and place it under the piece of brass on the stage, we shall see,
instead of the alternate black and white images, two coloured images
composed of the constituents of white light, which will alternately
change by revolving the eye-piece at every quarter of the circle;
then, by passing along the brass, the images will overlap; and at
the point at which they do so, white light will be produced. If, by
accident, the prism be placed at an angle of 45&deg; from the square
part of the stage, no particular colour will be perceived, and it will
then illustrate the phenomena of the neutral axis of the selenite,
because when placed in the relative position no depolarisation takes
place. The phenomena of polarised light may be further illustrated
by the addition of a second double image prism, and a film of
selenite adapted between the two. The systems of coloured rings
in crystals cut perpendicularly to the principal axis of the crystal
are best seen by employing the lowest object-glass.</p>

<p><i>Biaxial Crystals.</i>&mdash;To show perfectly the beautiful series of <i>rings
and brushes</i> which biaxial crystals exhibit, it becomes necessary to
convert the microscope, for the time being, into (so to speak) a wide-angled
telescope.

<p class="caption">Fig. 184.&mdash;Diagrammatic arrangement of the Polarising Microscope.</p></div>

<p><i>In Sub-stage</i>: P, polarising prism; C, sub-stage condenser on stage; M, mineral
or crystal. On nose-piece: O<sup>1</sup>, objective, <sup>4</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>-inch; A, analysing prism.</p>

<p><i>In Draw-tube</i>: O<sup>2</sup>, 2 or 3 inch Objective; H, Huyghenian eye-piece.</p>

<p>For the purpose, screw on a low-power objective to the end of
the draw-tube (<a href="#fig_184">Fig. 184</a>).<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> As the light requires to be passed
through the crystals at a considerable angle, a wide-angled condenser
should be employed, but it need not be achromatic. The objective
most suitable is a <sup>4</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>-inch, of ·64 numerical aperture, but a &frac14;-inch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
of ·71 numerical aperture, or a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>-inch of ·65 numerical aperture,
will answer the purpose equally well. As the whole of the back
lens of the objective should be visible through the analysing
Nicol prism, the back lens of the objective must not be too large;
thus a &frac12;-inch of ·65 numerical aperture will not be so effective. The
analysing prism may be placed either where it is in the drawing,
below the stage, or above the eye-piece. It works equally well above
the objective, the position it ordinarily occupies in the microscope.</p>

<p>For the draw-tube a 2-inch objective and a B Huyghenian eye-piece
answers very well. Before screwing the objective on to the end
of the draw-tube centre the light in the usual manner, the Nicol’s
being turned so as to give a light field, then screw the objective
on to the end of the aperture, and put the crystal on the stage, rack
down the body so that the objective on the nose-piece nearly touches
the crystal, then focus with the draw-tube only. The sub-stage
condenser should be racked up close to the underside of the crystal.</p>

<p>Opticians, however, have more recently furnished a special form
of microscope (<i>The Petrological Microscope</i>, <a href="#fig_79">Fig. 79</a>, p. 112), for the
use of those students who may desire to prosecute so fascinating
a study, and determine the optic axial angles of crystals.</p>

<p>Fuess<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> lately introduced a new form of microscope for polarising
and viewing biaxial crystals, which he believes to be needed, as in
the ordinary microscope the opening of the polariser is scarcely a
third of that of the condenser; moreover, it is not absolutely
necessary that the polariser and analyser should be Nicol’s prisms.
This fact was discovered by myself many years ago. Fuess utilises a
bundle of thin glass plates, as in the older Nuremberg polariscope.
The frame holding plates can be readily adjusted at the proper
polarising angle, the analyser being the ordinary small Nicol, screwed
above the objective. The illuminator is an Abbe’s triple condenser,
of numerical aperture 1·40, which can be adjusted in the ordinary
way. The front lens of this should have a diameter of 11·12 mm.
and the lower lens of 30 mm. This increase in the condenser fully
compensates for the loss of light by the bundle of glass plates, and
also enables thick sections of crystals to be examined in convergent
polarised light. The ocular used should have a large field; the
A Huyghenian answers best. A suggestion to return to the original
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
Nuremberg polariser is very opportune, as <i>Iceland spar is becoming
scarce</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Mickel accidentally discovered that an opalescent mirror
can be converted into an excellent and inexpensive substitute for
the Nicol-prism polariser.</p>

<h3>Rotation of Plane of Polarisation.</h3>

<p>When a plate of quartz (rock-crystal), even of considerable thickness,
cut perpendicular to the axis, is interposed between the polariser
and analyser, colour is exhibited, the tints changing as the analyser
is rotated; and similar effects of colour are produced by employing,
instead of quartz, a solution of sugar enclosed in a tube with plain
glass ends.</p>

<p>The action thus exerted by quartz and sugar is called <i>rotation of
the plane of polarisation</i>, a name which sufficiently expresses the
observed phenomena. In the case of ordinary quartz, and solutions
of sugar-candy, it is necessary to rotate the analyser in the direction
of watch-hands as seen by the observer, and the rotation of the plane
of polarisation is said to be <i>right-handed</i>. In the case of what is
called <i>left-handed</i> quartz, and of solutions of non-crystallisable sugar,
the rotation of the plane of polarisation is in the opposite direction,
and the observer must rotate the analyser against watch-hands.</p>

<p><i>Quartz</i> belongs to the uniaxial system of crystals, and accordingly
exhibits one series of rings only, and no perfect central black cross.</p>

<p>On revolving the tourmaline the colour gradually changes, and
passes through all the colours of the spectrum. It can be cut to
exhibit either right-handed polarisation or left-handed polarisation
and also to exhibit straight lines.</p>

<p><i>Calc Spar.</i>&mdash;A uniaxial crystal showing only one system of rings,
and a black cross, changing into a white cross on revolving the
tourmaline.</p>

<p><i>Topaz.</i>&mdash;A biaxial crystal exhibiting only one system of rings with
one fringe, owing to the wide separation of the axes. The fringe
and colours change on revolving the tourmaline.</p>

<p><i>Borax.</i>&mdash;A biaxial crystal; the colours are seen to be more intense
than in topaz, but the rings not so complete&mdash;only one set of rings
can be seen, owing to their wide separation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p><i>Rochelle Salt.</i>&mdash;A biaxial crystal; the colours are more widely
spread out than the former, and only one set of rings seen at the
same time.</p>

<p><i>Carbonate of Lead.</i>&mdash;A biaxial crystal; axes not so far separated,
and both systems of rings are more widely spread than those of
potassium nitrate.</p>

<p><i>Aragonite.</i>&mdash;A biaxial crystal; axes widely separated, but both
systems of rings seen at the same time. A fine crystal for displaying
the biaxial system.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_185" src="images/fig_185.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 185.&mdash;Crystal of Potassium Nitrate.</p></div>

<p>It was long believed that all crystals had only one axis of double
refraction; but Brewster found that the greater number of crystals
which occur in the mineral kingdom have <i>two axes</i> of double refraction,
or rather axes around which double refraction takes place; in
the axes themselves there is no double refraction.</p>

<p>Potassium nitrate crystallises in six-sided prisms with angles of
about 120&deg;. It has two axes of double refraction. These axes are
each inclined about 2&frac12;&deg; to the axes of the prism, and 5&deg; to each
other. If, therefore, a small piece be split off a prism of potassium
nitrate with a knife driven by a sharp blow of a hammer, and the
two surfaces polished perpendicular to the axes of the prism, so as
to leave the thickness of the sixth or eighth of an inch, and then
a ray of polarised light be transmitted along the axes of the prism,
the double system of rings will be clearly visible.</p>

<p>When the line connecting the two axes of the crystal is inclined
45&deg; to the plane of primitive polarisation, a cross is seen on
revolving the potassium nitrate; it gradually assumes the form of
two hyperbolic curves, as in <a href="#fig_185">Fig. 185</a>. But if the tourmaline be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
again revolved through half a quadrant, the black cross will be
replaced by white spaces, as in the second figure. These systems
of rings have, generally speaking, the same colours as those of thin
plates, or as those of a system of rings revolving around one
axis. The orders of the colours commence at the centres of each
system; but at a certain distance, which corresponds to the sixth
ring, the rings, instead of returning and encircling each pole, encircle
the two poles as an ellipse does its two foci. If the thickness of the
plate of <i>nitre</i> be diminished or increased, the rings are diminished or
increased according to the thickness of the crystal.</p>

<p>Small specimens of various salts may be crystallised and mounted
in Canada balsam for viewing under the stage of the microscope; by
arresting crystallisation at certain stages, a greater variety of forms
and colours will be obtained: we may enumerate salicine, asparagine,
acetate of copper, phospho-borate of soda, sugar, carbonate of lime,
potassium chlorate, oxalic acid, and all the oxalates found in urine,
with the other salts from the same fluid, a few of which are shown
in <a href="#pl_viii">Plate VIII</a>.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Herapath described a salt of quinine, remarkable for
its polarising properties. The crystals of this salt, when examined
by reflected light, have a brilliant emerald-green colour, with almost
a metallic lustre; they appear like portions of the elytr&aelig; of the
cantharides beetle, and are also very similar to murexide in appearance.
When examined by transmitted light, they scarcely possess any
colour, there is only a slightly olive-green tinge; but if two crystals,
crossing at right-angles, be examined, the spot where they intersect
appears perfectly black, even if the crystals are not more than one
five-hundredth of an inch in thickness. If the light be in the
slightest degree polarised&mdash;as by reflection from a cloud, or by the blue
sky, or from the glass surface of the mirror of the microscope placed at
the polarising angle 65&deg; 45′&mdash;these little prisms and films assume
complementary colours: one appears green, and the other pink, and
the part at which they cross is chocolate or deep chestnut-brown,
instead of black. Dr. Herapath succeeded in making artificial
tourmalines large enough to surmount the eye-piece of the microscope;
so that all experiments with those crystals upon polarised
light may be made without the tourmaline or Nicol’s prism. The
finest rosette crystals are made as follows:&mdash;To a moderately strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
solution of <i>Cinchonidine</i> add a drop or two of Herapath’s test-fluid.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>
A few drops of this is placed on the centre of a glass
slide, and put aside until the first crystals are observed to be
formed near the margin. The slide should now be placed upon the
stage of the microscope, and the progress of formation of the crystals
closely watched. When these are seen to be large enough, and it is
deemed necessary to stop their further development, the slide must
be quickly transferred to the palm of the hand, the warmth of which
will be found sufficient to stop further crystallisation. These crystals
attract moisture, deliquesce, and should therefore be kept in a
perfectly dry place.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_186" src="images/fig_186.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="hang">Fig. 186.&mdash;In this figure heraldic lines are adopted to denote colour.
The dotted parts indicate <i>yellow</i>, the straight lines <i>red</i>, the
horizontal lines <i>blue</i>, and the diagonal, or oblique lines, <i>green</i>.
The arrows show the plane of the tourmaline, <i>a</i>, blue stage;
<i>b</i>, red stage of selenite employed.</p></div>

<p>To render these crystals evident, it merely remains to bring the
glass-slide upon the field of the microscope, with the selenite stage
and single tourmaline, or Nicol’s prism, beneath it; instantly the
crystals assume the two complementary colours of the stage: red
and green, supposing that the pink stage is employed; or blue and
yellow, provided the blue selenite is made use of. All those crystals
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
at right angles to the plane of the tourmaline produce that tint
which an analysing-plate of tourmaline would produce when at right
angles to the polarising-plate; whilst those at 90&deg; to these educe
the complementary tint, as the analysing-plate would also have done
if revolved through an arc of 90&deg;.</p>

<p>This test is a delicate one for quinine  (<a href="#fig_186">Fig. 186</a>, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>); not
only do these peculiar crystals act in the way just related, but they
may be easily proved to possess the optical properties of that
remarkable salt, the sulphate of iodo-quinine.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_187" src="images/fig_187.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 187.&mdash;Polarised Crystals of Quinidine.</p></div>

<p>To test for quinidine, it is merely necessary to allow a drop of
acid solution to evaporate to dryness upon the slide, and to examine
the crystalline mass by two tourmalines, crossed at right angles, and
without the stage. Immediately little circular discs of white, with
a well-defined black cross, start into existence, should quinidine be
present even in very minute traces. These crystals are represented
in <a href="#fig_187">Fig. 187</a>.</p>

<p>If the selenite stage be employed in the examination of this
object, one of the most gorgeous appearances in the whole domain
of the polarising microscope is displayed: the black cross disappears,
and is replaced by one consisting of two colours, and divided into a
cross having a red and green fringe, whilst the four intermediate
sectors are a gorgeous orange-yellow. These appearances alter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
on the revolution of the analysing-plate of tourmaline; when the
blue stage is employed, the cross assumes a blue or yellow tint,
varying according to the position of the analysing plate. These
phenomena are analogous to those exhibited by certain circular
crystals of boracic acid, and to circular discs of salicine (prepared by
fusion), the difference being that the salts of quinidine have more
intense depolarising powers than either of the other substances; the
mode of preparation, however, excludes these from consideration.
Quinine prepared in the same manner as quinidine has a very
different mode of crystallisation; but it occasionally presents circular
corneous plates, also exhibiting the black cross and white sectors,
but not with one-tenth part of the brilliancy, which of course enables
us readily to discriminate the two.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>Urinary salts are more readily seen under polarised light than by
white light. Ice doubly refracts, while water singly refracts. Ice
takes the rhomboidic form; and snow in its crystalline forms may
be regarded as the skeleton crystals of this system (<a href="#fig_189">Fig. 189</a>). A
sheet of clear ice, of about one inch thick, and slowly formed in
still weather, shows circular rings with a cross by polarised light.</p>

cotton, whalebone; stems of plants containing silica or flint; barley,

This presents a black cross, the arms of which meet at the hilum
(<a href="#fig_190">Fig. 190</a>). On rotating the analyser,
the black cross disappears, and at 90&deg; is
replaced by a white cross; another, but
much fainter, black cross is seen between
the arms of the white cross, no colour
being perceptible. But if a thin plate of
selenite be interposed between the starch-grains
and the polariser, a series of delicate
colours appear, all of which change on
revolving the analyser, becoming complementary
at every quadrant of the circle. West and East India
arrow-root, sago, tapioca, and many other starch-grains, present
a similar appearance; but in proportion as the grains are smaller,
so are their markings and colourings less distinct.</p>

<h3>Molecular Rotation.</h3>

<p>For the purpose of studying the various interesting phenomena
of molecular rotation, a few necessary pieces of apparatus must be
added to the microscope. First, an ordinary iron three-armed retort
stand, to the lower arm of which must be attached either a polarising
prism or a bundle of glass plates inclined at the polarising angle;
in the upper an analysing prism. The fluid to be examined should
be contained in a narrow glass tube about eight inches in height,
and this must be attached to the middle arm. If the prisms be
crossed before inserting a fluid possessing rotatory power, the light
passing through the analyser will be coloured. If a solution of
sugar be employed, and the light which passes through the second
prism is seen to be red, but on rotating the analyser towards the
right the colour changes to yellow, and passes through green to
violet, it may be concluded that the rotation is right-handed. If,
on the contrary, the analyser requires to be turned towards the left
hand, we conclude that the polarisation is left-handed. These
phenomena are wholly distinct from those accompanying the action
of doubly refracting substances upon plane polarised light. It is
not easy to explain in a limited space the course to be followed in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
ascertaining the amount of rotation produced by different substances.
Monochromatic light should be used. If we are about to examine a
sugar solution with the prisms crossed, the index attached to the
analyser must first be made to point to zero. The sugar is then
introduced, when it will be necessary to rotate the analyser 23&deg; to
the right, in order that the light may be extinguished. This is the
amount of rotation for that particular fluid at a given density and
that height of column. As the arc varies with increase or decrease
of density and height of the fluid, it is needful to reduce it to a unit
of height and density. The following formula is that given by
Biot:&mdash;P = quantity of matter in a unit of solution; <i>d</i> = sp. gr.;
<i>l</i> = length of column; <i>a</i> = arc of rotation; <i>m</i> = molecular rotation.</p>

<p>Then <i>m</i> = <i>a</i>/(<i>l p d</i>).</p>

<p>The application of the polarising apparatus to the microscope is
of much value in determining minute structure. It may also be
defined as an instrument of analysis; a test of difference in density
between any two or more parts of the same substance. All structures,
therefore, belonging either to the animal, vegetable, or mineral
kingdom, in which the power of unequal or double refraction is
suspected to be present, are those that should especially be re-investigated
by polarised light. Some of the most delicate of the
elementary tissues of animal structure, the ultimate fibrill&aelig; of
muscles, &amp;c., are amongst the most interesting subjects that might
be studied with advantage under this method of investigation.
The chemist may perform the most dexterous analysis; the crystallographer
may examine crystals by the nicest determination of their
forms and cleavage; the anatomist or botanist may use the dissecting
knife and microscope with the most exquisite skill; but there are
still structures in the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms
which will defy all such modes of examination, and will yield only
to the magical analysis of polarised light.</p>

<h3>Formation and Polarisation of Crystals.</h3>

<p>The inorganic kingdom will afford to the microscopist a never-ending
number of objects of unsurpassed beauty and interest. The
phenomena of crystallisation in its varied combinations can be made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
a useful and instructive occupation. Although ignorant of the
means whereby the great majority of minerals and crystals have
been formed in the vast laboratory of Nature, we can, nevertheless,
imitate in a small degree Nature’s handiworks by crystallising out a
large number of substances, and watch their numerous transformations
in the smallest appreciable quantities, when aided by the microscope.</p>

<p>Among natural crystals we look for the material for the formation
of our lenses, while the varieties of granites present us with the
earliest crystallised condition of the earth’s crust as it cooled down,
the structure of which is beautifully exhibited under polarised light.

<p>The formation of artificial crystal may be readily effected, and the
process watched, under the microscope, by simply placing a drop of
saturated solution of any salt upon a previously warmed slip of glass.</p>

<p>Interesting results will be obtained by combining two or more
chemical salts in the following manner. To a nearly saturated
solution of the sulphate of copper and sulphate of magnesia add
a drop on the glass-slide, and dry quickly. To effect this, heat
the slide so as to fuse the salts in its water of crystallisation, and
there remains an amorphous film on the hot glass. Put the slide
aside and allow it to cool slowly; it will gradually absorb a certain
amount of moisture from the air, and begin to throw out crystals.
If now placed under the microscope, numerous points will be seen
to start out here and there. The starting points may be produced
at pleasure by touching the film with a fine needle point, so as to
admit of a slight amount of moisture being absorbed by the mass of
salt. Development is at once suspended by applying gentle heat;
cover the specimen with balsam and thin glass. The balsam should
completely cover the edges of the thin glass circle, otherwise moisture
will probably insinuate itself, and destroy the form of the crystals.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas succeeded in crystallising “the salts of the magnetic
metals” at very high temperatures, with very curious results. In
<a href="#pl_viii">Plate VIII</a>. are seen crystals of sulphate of iron and cobalt, No. 163;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
and of nickel and potash, No. 165, obtained in the following
manner:&mdash;Add to a concentrated solution of iron a small quantity of
sugar, to prevent oxidation. Put a drop of the solution on a glass
slide, and drive out the water of crystallisation as quickly as possible
by the aid of a spirit lamp; then with a Bunsen’s burner bring
the plate to a high temperature. Immediately a remarkable change
is seen to take place in the form of the crystal, and if properly
managed the “foliation” represented in the plate will be fairly
exhibited. The slide must not be allowed to cool down too rapidly
or the crystals will probably absorb moisture from the atmosphere,
and in so doing the crystals alter their forms. Immerse them in
balsam, and cover in the usual way before quite cold.</p>

<p><i>Sublimation of Alkaloids.</i>&mdash;The late Dr. Guy, F.R.S., directed the
attention of microscopists to the fact that the crystalline shape
of bodies belonging to the inorganic world might be of service in
medical jurisprudence. Subsequently, Dr. A. Helwig, of Mayence,
investigated this subject, and found the plan applicable not only to
inorganic but also to organic substances, and especially to poisonous
alkaloids. By using a white porcelain saucer Dr. Guy was able to
watch the process of crystallisation more minutely, and to regulate
it more exactly. He was, in fact, able to obtain characteristic crusts
composed of crystals of strychnine weighing not more than <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3000</sub>th
or <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>5000</sub>th of a grain. Morphia affords equally characteristic results.
For the examination of these, Dr. Guy recommended the use of a
binocular microscope with an inch object-glass. But it is not to
crystalline forms alone that one need trust; the whole behaviour of
a substance as it melts and is converted into vapour is eminently
characteristic, and when once deposited on the microscopical slide,
under the object-glass, the application of re-agents may give still more
satisfactory results. The re-agents, however, which are here to be
applied are not of the kind ordinarily employed. Colour-tests under
the microscope are, comparatively speaking, useless; those that give
rise to peculiar crystalline forms are rather to be sought after. For
instance, the crystals produced by the action of carbozotic acid on
morphia are by themselves almost perfectly characteristic. These
experiments should not, however, be undertaken for medico-legal
purposes by one unskilled in their conduct, for the effects of the
reagents themselves might be mistaken by the uninitiated for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
result of their action on the substance under examination. For the
special method of procedure, see Dr. W. Guy, “On the Sublimation
of the Alkaloids.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<h3>The Micro-spectroscope.</h3>

<p>Spectrum analysis has, from its first introduction by Kirschoff in
1859, maintained its fascination over men of science throughout the
civilised world. Microscopists, astronomers, and chemists have
assigned to the spectroscope a highly important position amongst
scientific instruments of research. At quite an early period of its
history it appeared to ourselves to promise an extension of the work
of the microscope in pathology and microscopy, and second only to
that of astronomy and chemistry. The chief hindrances to the use
of the spectroscope were, in the early days, of a twofold nature; a
widespread, but quite erroneous view of the serious difficulties of
employing the instrument, and the want of a first aid to its use.</p>

<p>So valuable a means of research has this process of analysis
proved to be, that the discoveries made by the spectroscope appear
marvellous. The spectroscope was first made known as a refined
instrument for the analysis of light by two Germans, a physicist and
a chemist, Kirschoff and Bunsen. In 1860, the latter succeeded in
detecting and separating two new alkaline bodies from all other
bodies from the waters obtained from the Durkeim springs, less than
0·0002 part of a milligramme of which can be detected by spectrum
analysis. It is to the labours of Huggins, Norman Lockyer and
others that we are indebted for the wonderful discoveries made in
astronomy; and chiefly so to Brewster, Herschel, and Talbot, for
showing that certain metals give off light of a high degree of
refrangibility; that distinct bands are situated at a distance beyond
the last visible violet ray ten times as great as the length of the
whole visible spectrum from red to violet.</p>

<p>With regard to the discoveries made in connection with physiological
research, we are indebted to F. Hoppe, who in 1862 first described
the absorption bands of human blood. His results were confirmed
by the investigations of Professor Sir George Gabriel Stokes, who,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
by adding certain reducing agents to the blood, found that he could
change scarlet blood into purple&mdash;“purple cruorine”&mdash;and in this
way the place occupied by the absorption band in the spectrum could
be made to change. He reduced the h&aelig;moglobin by robbing the
blood of its oxygen. Thus, by Stokes’ and other methods, we have
since arrived at extremely valuable results, and the explanation
of the difference in colour between arterial and venous blood; and it
has also enabled us to show wherein the breathing power of the red
corpuscles resides, and further explains phenomena which before his
investigations were inexplicable.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_191" src="images/fig_191.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 191.&mdash;Fr&auml;unhofer’s Spectrum Lines.</p></div>

<p>The spectroscope seems likely to be of almost as great use in
medicine as it has already proved to be in solar and terrestrial
chemistry, if we may form an opinion from the large amount of
literature which has appeared on the subject. The inception of this
magical instrument arose on the instance of a discovery made
by Dr. Wollaston in 1802, who, on making a slit in the shutter of
his room, instead of a round hole, the spectrum of sunlight, instead
of being composed of a number of coloured discs, was now a band of
pure colours, each colour being free from admixture with the next to
it. Moreover, he found that this colour band was not continuous,
as Newton described it, but interrupted here and there by <i>fine black
lines</i>.</p>

<p>In 1814, Fr&auml;unhofer,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> a German optician, discovered these lines
quite independently, and mapped out 576 of them, calling the more
prominent of them A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, which lines he used as
marks of comparison. He also found that the distances of these lines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
from each other may vary according to the nature of the substance
composing the prism; thus, their relative distances are not the same
in prisms of flint-glass, crown-glass, and bisulphide of carbon, but they
always occupy the same position relatively to the colours of the
spectrum. Kirschoff and Angstr&ouml;m had mapped out in 1880 no less
a number than 2,000 Fr&auml;unhofer lines, a portion of which are
correctly shown in the accompanying chart (<a href="#fig_191">Fig. 191</a>).</p>

<p>In 1830, Simms, a London optician, made an improvement in the
construction of the spectroscope by placing a lens in front of the
prism, so arranged that the slit was in the focus of the lens. This
lens turns the light, after it has passed through the slit, into a
cylindrical beam before entering the prism. Another lens, also introduced
by him, receives the circular beam emerging from the prism,
and compels it to throw an image of the slit, which may be magnified
at pleasure for each ray. The lens between the prism and the slit
is termed the <i>collimating</i> lens. Thus the following are the essential
parts of a chemical spectroscope:&mdash;(1) a slit, the edges of which are
two knife-edges of steel very truly ground, and exactly parallel to
each other, and in a direction parallel to the refracting edge of the
prism, to admit a pencil of rays. (2) A collimating lens; a convex
lens with the slit at its principal focus, which renders the rays
parallel before entering the prism. (3) A prism of dense glass, in
which the rays are refracted and dispersed. (4) An observing
telescope constructed like an astronomical refractor of small size,
and placed so that the rays shall traverse it after emerging
from the prism. Such are the essentials of a one-prism chemical
spectroscope.</p>

<p>The form of instrument in use with the microscope is the “<i>direct
vision</i>” spectroscope, consisting of two prisms of flint-glass, placed
between three of crown-glass cemented together by Canada balsam;
the spectrum being viewed directly by the eye. The earliest constructed
form of micro-spectroscope is shown in <a href="#fig_192">Fig. 192</a>, the Browning-Huggins.</p>

<p>It was, however, Mr. Sorby who suggested that the prism should
be made of dense flint-glass and of such a form that it could be used
in two different positions, and that in one it should give twice the
dispersion that it would in the other, but that the angle made by the
incident and emergent rays should be the same in both positions.

<p>Figs. 193 and 193<i>a</i> represent prisms of the kind arranged to use
in two different positions, i and i′ being the same angle as <small>I</small> and <small>I</small>′.</p>

<p>For most absorption-bands, particularly if faint, the prism should
be used in the first position, in which it gives the least dispersion;
when greater dispersion is required, so as to separate some particular
lines more widely, or to show the spectra of the metals, or Fr&auml;unhofer’s
lines in the solar spectrum, then the prism must be used as
in <a href="#fig_193">Fig. 193</a><i>a</i>. This answers well for liquids or transparent objects,
but it is, of course, not applicable to opaque objects.</p>

<p>To combine both purposes, some form of direct vision-prisms that
maybe applied to the body of the microscope is required. <a href="#fig_194">Fig. 194</a>
represents an arrangement of direct vision-prisms, invented by
Herschel. The line <small>R R</small>′ shows the path of a ray of light through
the prisms, where it would be seen that the emergent ray <small>R</small>′ is
parallel and coincident with the incident ray <small>R</small>.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 194<i>a</i>.</p></div></div>

<p>Another very compact combination is shown in <a href="#fig_194">Fig. 194</a><i>a</i>. Any
number of these prisms (<small>P P P</small>) may be used, according to the amount
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
of dispersion required. They are mounted in a similar way to a
Nicol’s prism, and are applied directly over the eye-piece of the
microscope. The slit <small>S S</small> is placed in the focus of the first glass (<small>F</small>)
if a negative, or below the second
glass if a positive eye-piece be
employed. One edge of the slit
is movable, and, in using the
instrument, the slit is first
opened wide, so that a clear
view of the object is obtained.
The part of the object of which
the spectrum is to be examined
is then made to coincide with
the fixed edge of the slit, and
the movable edge is screwed up,
until a brilliant coloured spectrum
is produced. The absorption-bands
will then be readily
found by slightly altering the focus. This contrivance answers
perfectly for opaque objects, without any preparation; and, when
desirable, the same prism can be
placed below the stage, and a micrometer
used in the eye-piece of the
microscope, thus avoiding a multiplicity
of apparatus.</p>

<p>A later and better form of instrument
is the Sorby-Browning eye-piece
(<a href="#fig_195">Fig. 195</a>), shown in section (<a href="#fig_196">Fig. 196</a>)
ready for inserting into the body-tube
of the microscope, the prism of which
is contained in a small tube, removable
at pleasure. Below the prism is an
achromatic eye-piece, having an adjustable
slit between the two lenses, the
upper lens being furnished with a screw motion to focus the slit.
A side slit, capable of adjustment, admits, when required, a second
beam of light from any object whose spectrum it is desired to compare
with that of the object placed on the stage of the microscope.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
This second beam of light strikes against a very small prism,
suitably placed inside the apparatus, and is reflected up through the
compound prism, forming a spectrum in the same field with that
obtained from the object on the stage.</p>

Another screw at right angles

round hole for a square-headed
screw, opening and shutting
a slit, admitting the quantity
of light required to form the
second spectrum. A light
entering the round hole near
<small>E</small> strikes against the right-angled
prism, which is placed
inside the apparatus, and is reflected up through the slit belonging
to the compound prism. If any incandescent object be placed in
a suitable position with reference to the round hole, its spectrum will
be obtained. <small>F</small> shows the position of the field lens of the eye-piece.
The tube is made to fit the microscope to which the instrument is
applied. To use this instrument insert <small>F</small> as an eye-piece in the
microscope tube, taking care that the slit at the top of the eye-piece
is in the same direction as the slit below the prism. Screw on to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
the microscope the object-glass required, and place the object whose
spectrum is to be viewed on the stage. Illuminate with the stage
mirror if it be transparent; with mirror, Lieberk&uuml;hn, and dark well,
by side reflector, or bull’s-eye condenser if opaque. Remove <small>A</small>, and
open the slit by means of the milled-head, not shown in figure, but
which is at right angles to <small>D D</small>. When the slit is sufficiently open
the rest of the apparatus acts as an ordinary eye-piece, and any
object can be focussed in the usual way. Having focussed the object,
replace <small>A</small>, and gradually close the slit till a good spectrum is
obtained. The spectrum will be much improved by throwing the
object a little out of focus.</p>

refrangibility, and delicate bands or lines can only be brought out
by accurately focussing that particular part of the spectrum. This
can be done by the milled-head <small>B</small>. Disappointment will occur in
any attempt at delicate investigation if the directions given be not
carefully followed out.</p>

<p>Opposite <small>E</small> a small mirror is attached. It is like the mirror below
the stage of a microscope, and is mounted in a similar manner. By
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
means of this mirror light may be reflected into the eye-piece, and
in this way two spectra may be procured from one lamp.</p>

<h3>Method of using the Micro-Spectroscope.</h3>

<p>A beginner with the micro-spectroscope should first make himself
fully acquainted with the spectroscope by holding it up to the sky
and noting the effects of opening and regulating the slit, by rotating
the screw <small>C</small>, Figs. 195 and 197. The lines will be well seen on closing
down the opening. This screw diminishes the length of the slit,
when the spectrum is seen as a narrow ribbon of prismatic colours.
The screw <small>E</small> regulates the admission of light through the aperture
above <small>D</small>. The better objects with which to commence the study
of the absorption bands are, aniline dye, much diluted, madder,
permanganate of potash, and blood. As each colour varies in refrangibility,
the focus must be adjusted by the screw <small>E</small>. When it is
desired to view the spectrum of a very minute object, the prisms
should be removed by withdrawing the tube containing them, the
slit set open, and the object brought into the centre of the field;
the vertical and horizontal slits must then be partially closed up,
and the prisms replaced, when a suitable objective is employed to
examine the spectrum. For ordinary observations a magnifying
power of an inch and a half or two inches will be suitable, but for
small quantities of material a higher power must be employed, when
a single blood corpuscle can be made to show its characteristic
absorption band. After having obtained the best image of any object
on stage, throw it slightly out of focus, and substitute the micro-spectroscopic
eye-piece for the Huyghenian. Opaque objects should
be examined by reflected light, by means of the bull’s-eye condenser,
or side reflector. Mr. Sorby uses a binocular microscope, which
enables him to regulate the focussing and throwing out of focus of
the object.</p>

<p>In examining crystals or other small objects, a small cardboard
diaphragm should be placed beneath them; and when examining the
spectra of liquids in cells, slip a small cap with a perforation of
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>-inch in diameter over the tube containing the &frac12;-inch or 2-inch
objective. Substances which give absorption bands or lines in the
red are best seen by artificial light, while those which show bands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
in the violet are better seen by daylight. By following rules of
the kind we are less likely to mix the bands of the absorption
spectrum with the Fr&auml;unhofer lines. For example, if the edge of a
band happens to coincide with a Fr&auml;unhofer line, the observer is
apt to imagine that the band is better defined and more abruptly
shaded on one side than it really is.</p>

<p><i>Cells and Tubes.</i>&mdash;These are either supplied ready-made by the
optician, or can be formed out of small pieces of barometer tubing,
with the edges ground down and cemented on ordinary glass slips.
In <a href="#fig_198">Fig. 198</a> is seen the several kinds of cells and tubes usually
employed, while the little flat tubes commonly in use as bouquet
holders will be found of use, with the side stage reflecting spectrum
as comparison tubes; being of different diameters they allow of two
or more depths of colour in the fluid intended for examination.</p>

<p>In the case of many other fluids the sloping form of cell (<a href="#fig_198">Fig. 198</a>)
will be useful, as different shades of fluids can be examined without
removal from the stage of the microscope. The deeper cells are cut
from a piece of barometer tubing of about half to an inch long, one
end being cemented to a piece of flatted glass, and the other covered
over temporarily or permanently with a thin piece of glass on the
top, held in its place by capillary attraction, thus admitting of the
tube being turned upside down.</p>

<p><i>Re-agents required.</i>&mdash;A diluted solution of ammonia, citric acid,
double tartrate of potash and soda (the last being used to prevent
the precipitation of oxide of iron), and the double sulphate of the
protoxide of iron and ammonia (employed to deoxidise blood, etc.).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
In some special cases, dilute hydrochloric acid, purified boric acid,
and sulphate of soda are required.</p>

<p>The character of stains of blood varies with age and with the
nature of the substance with which it happens to be combined.
This is important to remember in connection with <i>Jurisprudence</i>,
when the micro-spectroscope is brought into use for the detection of
blood stains. The spectrum used in important cases of the kind
should have a compound prism, with enough, but not too great
dispersive power, otherwise the bands become, as it were, diluted,
and less distinct.</p>

<p>If the blood stain is quite recent, the colouring matter will be
h&aelig;moglobin only. This easily dissolves out in water, and when
sufficiently diluted gives the spectrum of oxy-h&aelig;moglobin, which on
the addition of ammonia, together with a small quantity of the
double tartrate, a small piece of ferrous salt, and stirring carefully
without the admission of air, changes the spectrum of reduced
h&aelig;moglobin. When stirred again, so as to expose the solution as
much as possible to air, the two bands reappear; on gradually
adding citric acid in small quantities the colour begins to change,
and the bands are seen to gradually fade away; if there should have
been much blood present, a band appears in the red; the further
addition of ammonia makes all clear again, but does not restore the
original bands, because the h&aelig;moglobin has been permanently changed
into h&aelig;matin. This reaction alone distinguishes blood from most
other colouring matters, since other substances after being changed
by acids are restored by alkalies to their original state. There are
many other curious facts connected with the spectroscopic analysis
of blood, which are fully explained and illustrated by Dr. Maemunn
in his book on “The Use of the Spectroscope in Medicine,” and
also in Dr. Thudicum’s<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> reports and charts, which are the most
complete. Sir George Stokes, F.R.S., was one of the first to show
the essential value of the spectral phenomena of hematine, and who
proved, after Hoppe had first drawn attention to the fact, that this
colouring matter is capable of existing in two states of oxidation,
and that a very different spectrum is produced according as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
substance, which he termed <i>cruorine</i>, is in a more or less oxidised
condition. The chart appended to his paper<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> affords an imperfect
representation of the changes seen in the spectrum.</p>

<p>Proto-sulphate of iron, or proto-chloride of tin, causes the
reduction of the colouring-matter, but, on exposure to air, oxygen is
absorbed, and the solution again exhibits the spectrum characteristic
of the more oxidised state. The different substances obtained from
blood colouring-matter produce different bands. Thus, <i>h&aelig;matin</i>
gives rise to a band in the red
spectrum <small>D</small>; <i>h&aelig;mato-globulin</i>
produces two bands, the
second twice the breadth of
the first in the yellow portion
of the spectrum between
the lines <small>D</small> and <small>E</small>, No. 1.
The absorption-bands differ
according to the strength of
the solution employed, and
the medium in which the
blood-salt is dissolved; but
an exceedingly minute proportion
dissolved in water is
sufficient to bring out very
distinct bands. <small>B</small> represents
the red end of the spectrum
and <small>G</small> the green as it approaches
the violet end.</p>

<p><i>Mapping the Spectra.</i>&mdash;In the sectional view given of the micro-spectroscope
(<a href="#fig_196">Fig. 196</a>), the internal construction of the instrument
is shown, and the arrangement made for throwing a bright point
on to the surface of the upper prism is clearly seen. The mapping
out is accomplished by means of a photographic scale fixed as a
standard spectrum (<a href="#fig_198">Fig. 198</a>), in the position of <small>A A</small>, illuminated by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
the small mirror at <small>R</small>, and focussed by a small lens at <small>C</small>, so that on
looking into the instrument one can see the spectrum accurately
divided into one hundred equal parts, and scale readings can be
made at once; the only precaution needed is to be sure the <small>D</small> (or the
sodium line, if <small>D</small> cannot be got) always stands at the same number
on the scale. To map absorption spectra on this scale we have to
lay down a line, as many millimetres long as there are divisions
in the scale, and mark the position of the bands on this line.
Mr. Browning supplies scales printed off ready for use. But the
mapping out of spectra, as Mr. Sorby pointed out, requires some
consideration; since the number of divisions depends on the thickness
of the interference-plate, it becomes necessary to decide what
number should be adopted. Ten it was thought would be most
suitable; but, on trial, it appeared to be too few for practical work.
Twenty is too many, since it then becomes extremely difficult to
count them. Twelve is as many as can well be counted; it is
a number easily remembered, is sufficiently accurate, and has other
practical advantages. With twelve divisions the sodium-line 0 comes
very accurately at 3&frac12;; thus, by adjusting the plate so that a bright
sodium-light is brought into the centre of the band, when the Nicol’s
prisms are also crossed accurately at 3&frac12;, parallelism is secured,
together with a wider field of observation. The general character
of the scale will be best understood from the following figure, in
which the bands are numbered, and given below the principal
Fr&auml;unhofer lines. The centre of the bands is black, and they are
shaded off gradually at each side, so that the shaded part is about
equal to the intermediate bright spaces. Taking, then, the centres
of the black bands as 1, 2, 3, &amp;c., the centres of the spaces are
1&frac12;, 2&frac12;, 3&frac12;, &amp;c., the lower edges of each &frac34;, 1&frac34;, &amp;c., and the upper
1&frac14;, 2&frac14;, &amp;c., we can easily divide these quarters into eighths by the
eye: and this is as near as is required in the subject before us,
and corresponds as nearly as possible to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub>th part of the whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
spectrum, visible under ordinary circumstances by gaslight and
daylight. Absorption-bands at the red end are best seen by lamp-light,
and those at the blue end by daylight.</p>

<p>On this scale the position of some of the principal lines of the
solar spectrum is about as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>At first plates of selenite, which are easily prepared, were used,
because they can be split to nearly the requisite thickness with
parallel faces; but their depolarising power varied much with
temperature. Even the ordinary atmospheric changes alter the position
of the bands. However, quartz cut parallel to the principal
axis of the crystal is but slightly affected, and is not open to the
same objection; but this is prepared with some difficulty. The sides
should be perfectly parallel, the thickness about ·043-inch, and
gradually polished down with rouge until the sodium-line is seen in
its proper place. This must be done with care, since a difference of
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10000</sub>-inch in thickness would make it almost worthless.</p>

<p>The two Nicol’s prisms and the intervening plate are mounted in
a tube, and attached to a piece of brass in such a manner that the
centre of the aperture exactly corresponds to the centre of any of
the cells used in the experiments, and must be made to correspond
with equal care, so that any of them, or this apparatus in particular,
may be placed on the stage and in proper position without further
adjustment, whereby both time and trouble are saved.</p>

<h3>Absorption Spectrum of Chromule.</h3>

<p>In 1869 I published in the Journal of the Royal Microscopical
Society<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> a paper on results obtained by the spectrum analysis
of the colouring-matter of plants and flowers, some of which
were of considerable interest in many respects. My examinations
extended to several hundred different specimens, from which I
was led to conclude that the chromule of flowers is, for the most
part, due to the chemical action of the actinic rays of light over the
protoplasm of the plant, more so than to that of soil. But as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
certain roots of plants, as those of the alkanet, yield their colouring-matter
to oil, and in a much smaller degree to spirit or water,
it follows then that conclusions of any kind can only be drawn
after a long and careful study of the question. Some of the
results obtained were, however, of some interest at the time, that, for
example, seen in three different solutions of the chlorophyll of
<i>Cinchona succirubra</i>, one of three solutions in alcohol, scarcely
coloured, having in fact only a faint tinge of green colour, and the
spectrum of which much astonished me at the time. It gave four
well-marked absorption-bands; one deep sharp line <i>in the red</i>; another,
rather narrower, in the orange, coincident with <small>D</small>, or the sodium-line;
one in the green, about <i>b</i>, coincident with the Thallium green
band; and a fourth on the blue line <small>F</small>, nearly as broad as that in
the red. The ethereal solution gave different results. It showed
only three bands of absorption, nearly the same as in the last case
(though all of them fainter); but the fourth in the blue was not
apparent, the whole of that end of the spectrum being absorbed a
little beyond the green line <i>b</i>. This solution was <i>deep emerald-green</i>,
and even dilution did not alter the phenomena. The <i>acid</i>
alcoholic solution was as deeply green as the last, but gave only
the sharp broad absorption-band in the red, and two very faint
ghostly bands in the position described above of the <small>D</small> and <i>b</i> lines
respectively.</p>

<p>Further additional researches on the chlorophyll of plants furnished
curious results, the chlorophyll being dissolved out by alcohol,
digested for some hours, and without heat; some plants being
fresh, and others dried. Five classes of phenomena exhibited
themselves, but <i>all</i> agreed in having the red absorption-band broad,
sharp, and well defined, some having this one band only, the Lilac
being of this type.</p>

<p>There are two classes in which two absorption-bands occur. One
has the red and the orange bands, of which the Fuchsia, Guelder-rose,
and Tansy are examples; another, in which the red and the green
bands are alone co-existent. Ivy is the type of the class, and it is
immaterial whether we take last year’s leaves or those of the early
spring; the results are the same.</p>

<p>The fourth class consists of the two former spectra superposed.
Three lines occur, the red, the orange, and the green bands, at <small>C</small>, <small>D</small>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
and <i>b</i>, as before. This is by far the largest class, and I have thirty
or forty examples of it. <i>Œnothera biennis</i>, Laurestinus, &amp;c., are
types with the ethereal solution of the leaves of Red Bark.</p>

<p>The fifth class consists of those having properties similar to the
alcoholic solution of Red Bark described. But I only found eight
of these, and not all equal in colour power, namely: Berberry, Sloe,
Tea, Hyoscyamus, Digitalis, Senna, and Red Bark. The results
obtained appeared at the time to be well worth following up to
a more practical conclusion than that arrived at. It should be
noted that in the preparation of vegetable colouring matters for
the micro-spectroscope, care must be taken to employ only a small
quantity of spirits of wine to filter the solution, and evaporate it at
once to dryness at a very gentle heat, otherwise if we attempt to keep
the colouring matters in a fluid state they quickly decompose. It
is necessary also to employ various re-agents in developing characteristic
spectra. The most valuable re-agent is sulphite of soda. This
admits of the division of colours into groups.</p>

<p>It is better to use a dilute alcoholic solution for the extraction of
colour from plants, and to observe the spectrum in a column of
about three-quarters of an inch in height. By this means it is quite
possible to ascertain that the spectrum of chlorophyll presents seven
distinct absorption bands.</p>

<p>For further information on this interesting subject I must refer
the reader to Mr. Sorby’s paper “On a Definite Method of Qualitative
Analysis of Vegetable and Animal Colouring Matter by means
of the Spectrum Microscope,” “Proc. Roy. Soc.,” No. 92, 1867.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>Practical Microscopy: Manipulation, and Mode of Using
the Microscope.</h3>

<p>In this chapter it will be my aim to discuss the best practical
methods of employing the microscope and its appliances to the
greatest advantage. First, the student should select a quiet room
for working in, with, if possible, a northern aspect, free from all tremor
occasioned by passing vehicles. The table selected for use should be
firm, and provided with drawers, in which his several appliances can
be kept ready to hand. The microscope must be placed at such an
inclination as will enable him to work in comfort, and without putting
strain on the muscles of the neck or fatiguing the eyes. The next
important point is that of light. Daylight, in some respects, is an
advantage; this should come from a white cloud on a bright day, but
as a rule more satisfactory results will be obtained by using a well-made
lamp, as this can be controlled with ease, and used at a proper
height and distance from the microscope. To have a good form of
lamp is as much to be desired for the student as for those engaged
in the more advanced work of microscopy.</p>

<p>Whatever the source of light we must on no account over-illuminate.
The object having been placed on the stage of the
microscope, the body should be racked down to within a quarter or
half an inch of the specimen, and then, while looking through the
eye-piece, should be slowly withdrawn until a sharp image comes into
view. The fine adjustment may now be used for the more delicate
focussing of the several parts of the field.</p>

<p>Accurate adjustment of focus is required when using a &frac14;-inch
objective; details of the object, as stri&aelig;, being brought into view
when a stronger light is thrown obliquely upon them from the mirror.
If a 1-inch objective is used the light often proves to be in excess of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
what is required, and this must be regulated by the aid of the
diaphragm.</p>

<p>The iris diaphragm, made to drop into the under-stage, is more
generally employed, as when racked up to the object it affords every
necessary graduation of illumination.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_201" src="images/fig_201.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 201.&mdash;Bull’s-eye Lens.</p></div>

<p>To illuminate opaque objects the light should be thrown upon them
from above by the bull’s-eye lens (<a href="#fig_201">Fig. 201</a>). The focus of such a lens
and the lamp placed at four inches from it, is about three inches for
daylight, or two inches for artificial light. A large object may be
placed upon the stage of the microscope at once, but smaller objects are
either laid on a glass slide or
held in the stage forceps.</p>

<p>When illuminating objects
from above all light from the
mirror, or that which might
enter the objective from below
the stage, should be carefully
excluded. <i>Dark-field illumination</i>
is a means of seeing
a transparent object as an
opaque one. The principle,
however, is that all the light
shall be thrown from below
the object, but so obliquely
that it cannot enter the object-glass
unless interrupted by the object; this is best accomplished by
<i>Wenham’s Parabola</i>.</p>

<p><i>Glass</i> of any kind requires occasional cleaning; a piece of soft
washed chamois leather should be used for this purpose. The fronts
of the objectives may be carefully wiped, but not <i>unscrewed</i> or
tampered with; a short thick-set camel’s hair brush may be passed
down to the back lens, and all dust removed without doing any harm.
If the objective is an <i>immersion</i>, carefully remove the fluid from the
front lens, as even distilled water will leave a stain behind. For
removing oil see special directions given at page 171.</p>

<p>When cleaning the <i>eye-pieces</i>, which should be done occasionally,
the cells containing the glasses must be unscrewed and replaced one
at a time, so that they may not be made to change places.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></p>

<p>Any dirt upon the <i>eye-pieces</i> may be detected by turning them
round whilst looking through the instrument; but if the <i>object-glasses</i>
are not clean, or are injured, it will, for the most part, only be seen
by the object appearing misty.</p>

<p>The <i>object-glasses</i>, when in use but not on the microscope, should
be stood upon the table with the screw downwards, to prevent dust
getting into the lenses, and they should always be put into their
brass cases when done with. A large bell-glass shade will be found
the most useful cover for keeping dust from the instrument when
not in use.</p>

<p>When looking through the eye-piece be sure to place the eye in
close proximation to the cap, otherwise the whole field will not be
perfectly visible; it should appear as an equally well-illuminated
circular disc. If the eyelashes are reflected from the eye-glass, the
observer is looking upon the eye-piece, and not through it.</p>

<p><i>The Mirror.</i>&mdash;The working focal distance of the mirror is that
which brings the images of the window-bars sharply out upon the
object resting upon the stage. In other words, the focus of the
mirror is that which brings parallel rays to a correct focus on the
object-glass. If employing artificial light, then the flame of the
lamp should be distinguishable; a slight change in the inclination
of the mirror will throw the image of the lamp-flame out of
the field.</p>

<p>The strongest light is reflected from the concave side of the
mirror, that from the flat side is more diffuse and less intense.
Oblique light can be obtained by turning the mirror on one side
and then adjusting it so as to illuminate the field from that position.
All the necessary mechanism of the microscope is easily and quickly
learned. The object-glasses or objectives are, as previously
explained, designated according to the focal distance of a single
lens of the same magnifying power. Thus a 2-inch objective is
understood to be a combination which has the magnifying power of
a single lens whose focal point is two inches from the object, and so
on with reference to other powers. By the aid of different eye-pieces
an extensive range of magnifying power can be obtained; for example,
the 2-inch objective with a deep eye-piece will give the same
amplification as the quarter objective with the ordinary eye-piece.
Indeed, for certain observations, the combination of a wide-angled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
low-power objective, with a deep eye-piece, or <i>compensating eye-piece</i>,
is considered to have an advantage.</p>

<p>It has been already explained that two objectives, one of much
greater power than the other, but both having only the same
numerical aperture, will show only the same amount of <i>detail</i>; the
higher power on a larger scale. That is, supposing with a &frac14;-inch
objective of 1·0 numerical aperture certain structure is resolved, then
a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>-inch substituted with exactly the same numerical aperture, but
with double the magnification, no more <i>resolving power</i> will be found
in the latter objective than in the former. For this reason a doubt
has been expressed as to whether high-power objectives&mdash;especially
the more expensive oil-immersions, made to transmit large pencils of
light through their larger apertures&mdash;are so well adapted for ordinary
research as the best series of dry achromatic objectives, or even,
in some instances, the medium aperture lenses; undoubtedly, for
histological (physiological and pathological) work, the latter will be
found to meet the students’ requirements quite as well as the former.</p>

<p>The student or amateur will do well to commence with moderate
or medium powers, a 2-inch, a 1-inch, a &frac12;-inch, a <sup>4</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>-inch, or &frac14;-inch.
These, together with the A and B eye-pieces, will give a range of
magnification from 30 to 250 diameters.</p>

<p><i>Penetration</i> in the objective is a quality for consideration, as the
adjustment of high powers is a work of delicacy, and in some cases
their penetration is impaired by the arrangement made to obtain
finer definition. The value, however, of penetration in an objective
is always considered to be of more or less importance. It
is a quality whereby, under certain conditions, a more perfect insight
into structure is obtained. As a rule, the objective having the
largest working distance possesses the better penetration. Theoretically,
the penetration of an objective decreases as the square of the
angular aperture increases. For this reason the medical student
will be justified in choosing the objectives I have named, since these
will be better adapted to his work and pursuits. The penetration
of the objective is a relative quality assessed at a different value by
workers whose aims are widely different. But for the observation of
living organisms, the cyclosis within the cell of the closterium or
valisneria, for instance, preference will undoubtedly be in favour of
the objective with good penetration.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p><i>Resolving Power.</i>&mdash;This is a quality highly prized by the bacteriologist.
In the case of the high-angled apochromatic oil-immersion,
with its compensating eye-piece, its resolution is found to be of very
considerable advantage, because of its capacity to receive and
recombine all the diffraction spectra that lie beyond the range of
the older achromatic objective, with its smaller angular aperture.
The actual loss of resolving power consequent upon the contraction
of aperture from 180&deg; to 128&frac12;&deg; is ten per cent., if not more.
Resolution depends, then, upon the quality and quantity of the light
admitted, the power of collecting the greatest number of rays, and
the perfection of centring. In other words, upon the co-ordination
of the illuminating system of the microscope&mdash;mirror, achromatic
condenser, objective and eye-piece. If diatoms are employed as
test-objects, it should not be forgotten that there are great differences,
even in the same species, in the distances their lines are apart. For
this reason ruled lines of known value, as Nobert’s lines, are to be
preferred. The following example will suffice to show the value of
a dry <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>-inch objective of 120&deg; in defining the rulings of a 19-band
plate, which is equivalent to the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>67000</sub>th of an inch. This objective,
with careful illumination, showed them all; but when cut down by
a diaphragm to 110&deg;, the eighteenth line was not separable; further
cut down to 100&deg; the seventeenth was the limit, to 80&deg; the
fourteenth, and to 60&deg; the tenth was barely reached.</p>

<p><i>Flatness of Field.</i>&mdash;This quality in the objective has, by the
introduction of the immersion system, lost much of the importance
formerly attached to it. Some writers assume it to be an “optical
impossibility.” The compensating eye-piece has had the effect of
contracting the visual field, consequently the peripheral imperfections
of the objective are of a less disturbing character. It has, however,
not been made perfectly clear whether the highest perfection of
the two primary qualities of a good objective, <i>defining power
and resolving power</i>, can be always obtained in one and the same
combination of lenses.</p>

<p>Doubtless, <i>defining</i> power can be more satisfactorily determined
by the examination of a suitable object, and the perfection of the
image obtained; to assist in securing which, a solid axial cone of
light equal to about three-fourths of the aperture of the objective
must be employed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

<p>To sum up, then, “the focal power of all objectives depends in
their perfect <i>definition</i>, a property on which their converging power
depends, and in turn their magnifying action is dependent; again,
focal power is the curvature imprinted by the lens on a plane wave,
and is reciprocal of the true focal length. It is appropriately
expressed in terms of the proper unit of focal curvature, the <i>dioptric</i>;
a unit of curvature.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 202.&mdash;Seiler’s Test Slide.</p></div>

<p>It may be taken as an axiom with microscopists that “neither the
penetrating power nor the high-power defining objective is alone
sufficient for every kind of work. The larger the details of ultimate
structure, the narrower the aperture&mdash;and the converse; the minuter
the dimensions of elementary structure, the wider must be the
aperture of the objective.” Every worker with the microscope must
have satisfied himself of the
truth of this statement, when
engaged in the study of the
movements of living organisms,
or defining the intimate structure
of the minuter diatoms, or
of the podura scale.</p>

<p><i>Test for Illumination.</i>&mdash;Dr.
C. Seiler recommends the human
blood corpuscle as the best test of good illumination. He prepares
the object in the following manner: Take for the purpose a clean
glass slide of the ordinary kind, and place near its extreme edge a
drop of fresh blood drawn by pricking the finger with a needle.
Then take another slide of the same size, with ground edges, and
bring one end in contact with the drop of blood, as shown in
<a href="#fig_202">Fig. 202</a>, at an angle of 45&deg;; then draw it evenly and quickly
across the underslide, and the result will be to spread out the
corpuscles evenly throughout. Blood discs being lenticular bodies,
with depressed centres, act like so many little glass-lenses, and
show diffraction rings if the light is not properly adjusted.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p><i>Errors of Interpretation.</i>&mdash;To be in a position to draw an accurate
conclusion of the nature and properties of the object under examination
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
is a matter of great importance to the microscopist. The viewing
of objects by transmitted light is of quite an exceptional character,
rather calculated to mislead the judgment as well as the eye. It
requires, therefore, an unusual amount of care to avoid falling into
errors of interpretation. Among test objects the precise nature of
the structural elements of the Diatomace&aelig; have given rise to great
divergence of opinion. Then, again, the minute scales of the podura
Springtails, one of the Collembola, and their congeners <i>Lepisma
saccharina</i>, the structure of which is equally debatable. Mr. R. Beck,
in an instructive paper published in the “Transactions of the Royal
Microscopical Society,” says that the scales of the Lepisma can be
made to put on an appearance which bears little resemblance to their
actual structure.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_203" src="images/fig_203.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 203.&mdash;Portions of Scales of Lepisma.</p></div>

<p>In the more abundant kind of scales the prominent markings
appear as a series of double lines. These run parallel and at considerable
intervals from end to end of the scale, whilst other lines,
generally much fainter, radiate from the quill, and take the same
direction as the outline of the scale when near the fixed or quill end;
but there is, in addition, an interrupted appearance at the sides of
the scale, which is very different from the mere union, or “cross-hatchings,”
of the two sets of lines (<a href="#fig_203">Fig. 203</a>, Nos. 1 and 2, the
upper portions).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<p>The scales themselves are formed of some truly transparent substance,
for water instantly and almost entirely obliterates their
markings, but they reappear unaltered as the moisture leaves them;
therefore the fact of their being visible at all, under any circumstances,
is due to the refraction of light by superficial irregularities,
and the following experiment establishes this fact, whilst it determines
at the same time the structure of each side of the scale, which it is
otherwise impossible to do from the appearance of the markings in
their unaltered state:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Remove some of the scales by pressing a clean and dry slide
against the body of the insect, and cover them with a piece of thin
glass, which may be prevented from moving by a little gum at each
corner. No. 3 may then be taken as an exaggerated section of the
various parts. <small>A B</small> is the glass slide, with a scale, <small>C</small>, closely adherent
to it, and <small>D</small> the thin glass-cover. If a very small drop of water be
placed at the edge of the thin glass, it will run under by capillary
attraction; but when it reaches the scale, <small>C</small>, it will run first between
it and the glass slide, <small>A B</small>, because the attraction there will be greater,
and consequently the markings on that side of the scale which is in
contact with the slide will be obliterated, while those on the other
side will, for some time at least, remain unaltered: when such is the
case, the strongly marked vertical lines disappear, and the radiating
ones become continuous. (<i>See</i> No. 1, the lower left-hand portion.)
To try the same experiment with the other, or inner surface of the
scales, it is only requisite to transfer them, by pressing the first
piece of glass, by which they were taken from the insect, upon
another piece, and then the same process as before may be repeated
with the scales that have adhered to the second slide, the radiating
lines will now disappear, and the vertical ones become continuous.
(<i>See</i> No. 2, left portion.) These results, therefore, show that the
interrupted appearance is produced by two sets of uninterrupted lines
on different surfaces, the lines in each instance being caused by
corrugations or folds on the external surfaces of the scales. Nos. 1
and 2 are parts of a camera lucida drawing of a scale which happened
to have opposite surfaces obliterated in different parts. No. 4 shows
parts of a small scale in a dry and natural state; at the upper part
the interrupted appearance is not much unlike that seen at the sides
of the larger scales; but lower down, where lines of equal strength
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
cross nearly at right angles, the lines are entirely lost in a series of
dots, and exactly the same appearance is shown in No. 5 to be produced
by the two scales at a part where they overlie each other,
although each one separately shows only parallel vertical lines.”</p>

1·40, magnifying power 1,750 diameters.</p></div>

<p>A well-known skilled observer of test objects<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> says: “Practically
the resolving power of our achromatic objectives on lined objects
reached their maximum in the late Dr. Woodward’s hands. <i>Amphipleura
pellucida</i> was then, as now, the finest known regular structure
of the diatoms. There appeared then nothing more to be gained in
resolution when one of the apochromatic <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch objectives of Zeiss,
with its entire absence of colour, passed into my hands, and I soon
became convinced that it possessed the power of separating the
different layers of structure in the valve, beyond the grasp of the
dry-objective. The result of this increase of power enabled me to
split up, as it were, the one plate of silex forming the valve of
<i>Pleurosigma formosum</i> into three layers, and which had never before
appeared to be possible; proving, in fact, that magnification without
corresponding aperture is of little or no account.”</p>

<p>“The intimate structure of these test objects,” says Mr. Smith, “is
built up on one plan, each being composed of two or more layers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
(1) a valve with two layers, as in <i>Pleurosigma balticum</i>; (2) two
layers with a grating and secondary markings placed diagonally, as
in <i>Pleurosigma formosum</i>; (3) with two layers of a net-like structure,
as in <i>Pleurosigma angulatum</i>, the fineness of the stri&aelig; or gratings
of which measure the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>50000</sub>th of an inch. Five other diatoms afford
evidence of this compound structure. The presence of beads or
hemispheres in one of the focal planes, and depressions or pits in
another, are emphasised in the micro-photograph itself; reduced
portions of the valve are represented in Figs. 204 and 204<i>a</i>.”</p>

<p>A portion of a diatom valve, <i>Pleurosigma angulatum</i>, micro-photographed
on a higher scale of magnification, 4,500 diameters,
is given further on.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 205.&mdash;Sections of an old-fashioned Glass Tumbler, from photographs
by the late Mr. R. Beck.</p></div>

<p><i>Errors of interpretation</i> arise either from the small cones of
illumination afforded by the dry-objective, or the oblique illumination
formerly resorted to for the resolution of these difficult test objects,
and several of the lights and shadows resulting from the refractive
power of the object itself. But the most common error is that
produced by the reversal of the lights and shadows resulting from
the refractive powers of the object itself. To make this clear,
I reproduce two reduced photographs of a small section of an
old-fashioned glass tumbler, covered externally with numerous hemispheres,
illuminated by transmitted light (<a href="#fig_205">Fig. 205</a>).</p>

<p>This illustration well emphasises the difficulty there is in determining
structure under precisely similar conditions to those we are
accustomed to of examining valves of diatoms under the microscope.
If these photographs be held in front of a strong light, they at once
convey different impressions to the mind, the hemispheres appearing
depressions in the one, and raised beads in the other. Both are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
prints from the same negative, but in mounting are reversed; and
therefore the apparent dissimilarity is due to a slight inequality of
illumination, which the mind accepts as light and shade.</p>

<p>Very similar appearances to those described will result if a thin
plate of glass were studded with minute, equal, and equi-distant
plano-convex lenses, the foci of which would very nearly lie in the
same plane. If the focal surface, or plane of vision, of the objective
be made to coincide with this plane, a series of bright points will
result, from the excess of light falling on each lens. If the plane
of vision be next made to coincide with the surfaces of the lenses,
these points would appear dark, in consequence of the rays being
refracted towards points <i>now</i> out of focus. Lastly, if the plane of
vision be made to coincide with the plane <i>beneath</i> the lenses that
contain their several foci, so that each lens may be, as it were,
combined with the object-glass, then a second series of bright points
will result from the accumulation of the rays transmitted at those
points. Moreover, as all rays capable of entering the objective are
concerned in the formation of the second series of bright focal
points, the first series being formed by the rays of a cone of light
only, it is evident that the circle of least confusion must be much
less, and therefore the bright points better defined in the first than
in the last series.</p>

<p>There are no set of objects which have given rise to more
discussion as to their precise character than the scales of the podura
(<i>Lepidocyrtus cervicollis</i>), to the intimate structure of which Mr. Smith
turned his attention, and succeeded, I am inclined to think, in his
attempt to settle the structure of these very minute scales, and
which heretofore have been described as “notes of exclamation.”
By the aid of the same power as that employed in the examination
of the <i>pleurosigma formosum</i>, the old conventional markings have
disappeared, and well-defined “<i>featherlets</i>” have taken their place.
By careful focussing up and down, a series of whitish pin-like bodies
is to be seen, with an intervening secondary structure. A micro-photograph
of a portion of a scale taken by Mr. Smith shows that
these pin-like bodies are inserted in a fold of the basement membrane,
which, in his opinion, furnish unmistakable evidence of the fact
that these projecting bodies are real, and must no longer be looked
upon as mere <i>ghosts</i>. Quite recently, a micro-photograph of a portion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
of a podura scale was placed in my hands, taken by Mr. J. W. Gifford
with a Swift’s <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>-inch apochromatic objective, of numerical aperture
1·40, and a deep eye-piece, having a combined magnifying power of
3,827 diameters. <a href="#fig_206">Fig. 206</a> shows a portion of the photograph which,
it will be admitted, supports Mr. Smith’s view of the structure of the
podura scale.</p>

<p>Many other errors of interpretation are not unknown to the
experienced operator with the microscope, arising, for the most part,
from an influence exerted by peculiarities in the internal structure of
certain objects; for example, that offered by the human hair, and
which, when viewed by transmitted light, presents the appearance of
a flattened-out band, with a darkish centre, due to the refractive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
influence of the rays of light transmitted through the hair. That
it is a solid or tubular structure is proved by making a transverse
section of the hair-shaft, when it is seen filled up by medullary
matter, the centre being somewhat darker than the outer part. It
is, in fact, a spiral outgrowth of the epithelial scales, overlapping
each other, imparting a striated appearance to the surface. A
cylindrical thread of glass in balsam appears as a flattened, band-like
streak, of little brilliancy. Another instance of fallacy arising
from diversity in the refractive power of the internal parts of an
object is furnished by the mistakes formerly made with regard to
the true character of the <i>lacun&aelig;</i> and <i>canaliculi</i> of bone structure.
These were long supposed to be solid corpuscles, with radiating
opaque filaments proceeding from a dense centre; on the contrary,
they are minute chambers, with diverging passages&mdash;excavations in
the solid osseous structure. That such is the case is shown by the
effects of Canada balsam, which infiltrates the osseous substance.</p>

<p>Air bubbles are a perplexing source of trouble. The better way
of becoming accustomed to deceptive appearances of the kind is to
compare the aspect of globules of oil in water with bubbles of air in
water, or Canada balsam.</p>

<p>The molecular movements of finely divided particles, seen in
nearly all cases when certain objects are first suspended in water, or
other fluids, are a frequent cause of embarrassment to beginners. If
a minute portion of indigo or carmine be rubbed up with a little
water, and a drop placed on a glass slide under the microscope, it
will at once exhibit a peculiar <i>perpetual motion</i> appearance. This
movement was first observed in the granular particles seen among
pollen grains of plants, known as <i>fovilla</i>, and which are set free
when the pollen is crushed. Important vital endowments were
formerly attributed to these particles, but Dr. Robert Brown showed
that such granules were common enough both in organic and
inorganic substances, and were in no way “indicative of life.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>Professor Jevons succeeded in throwing light on these curious
movements. He showed that they were not due to evaporation, as
some observers contended, as they continue when all possibility of
evaporation is cut off, when the fluid is surrounded by a layer of oil,
and enclosed in an air-tight case: but as Professor Jevons pointed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
out, these movements are greatly affected by the admixture of
various substances with water, being increased by a small quantity
of gum, and checked by a drop of sulphuric acid, or a few grains
of some saline substance, which increases the conducting power of
water for electricity. The Brownian movement, now termed <i>pedesis</i>,
much depends upon the size of the particles, their specific gravity,
and the nature of the liquid in which they are immersed.</p>

<p>The correct conclusions to be drawn by the microscopist regarding
the nature of an object will necessarily depend upon previous
experience in microscopic observations, a knowledge of the class of
bodies brought under observation, and the skill of the observer in
the use of the instrument&mdash;that is, in securing the best focus possible
with any objective brought into use. I am indebted to Messrs.
Beck for the following series of illustrations, showing the effect of
under and over correction of the objective.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Directions for finding the best Focus.</span></h3>

<p>The method of finding and determining when the screw-collar
adjustment of the high-power objective has arrived at a point of
perfect definition and magnification is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Select any dark speck of dust, or an opaque portion of the object,
and carefully focus this small particle by working the screw of the
fine adjustment, move the screw up and down until you are satisfied
the image is the sharpest and blackest that can be obtained, then
once more test the focus a little above and a little below while
closely scrutinising the effect on the image. It will now be seen
that whereas in focussing on one side of the best focus the object
disappears in a fog, by focussing on the other side it remains in view
for a longer period, but alters its appearance; it is now no longer a
black dot, but a bright dot of light surrounded by a black margin.
The effects being thus dissimilar on different sides of the best focus,
show that the objective is not perfectly adjusted for the cover-glass
in use.</p>

<p>The next step is to find out whether the bright image is above or
below the best focus, as on this depends the direction in which the
adjustment-collar should be turned. To determine this it is only
necessary to ascertain which way the slow-motion milled head of the
microscope turns when moving the objective upwards.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span></p>

<p>In the case under consideration, the bright image will be <i>above</i>
the best focus, which shows that the cover-glass in use is <i>thicker</i>
than that for which the objective is adjusted, consequently the
adjustment-collar must be moved in the opposite direction.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_207" src="images/fig_207.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 207.&mdash;Podura Scale Test.</p></div>

<p>If the collar be turned too far in the opposite direction, it will be
found that the bright image is <i>below</i> the best focus, and the cover-glass
is then <i>thinner</i> than that for which the objective is adjusted.
The collar must then be turned back again <i>until the effect on each
side of the best focus is exactly similar</i>. This effect in the case of a
circular speck of dust will be that the object disappears equally
rapidly on either side, and does not instantly vanish into fog, on
either side presenting the bright spot appearance, though not in
so marked a degree on either side. When the object is in perfect
adjustment the expansion of the outline is exactly the same, both
within and without the focus.</p>

<p>A different indication, however, is afforded by such test-objects as
the finer diatoms, and the podura scale, in which we have to do with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
a set of distinct dots and other markings. If the dots have a tendency
to run into lines when the object is <i>without</i> the focus, the glasses
should be brought closer together; on the contrary, if the lines
appear when the object is <i>within</i> the focal point, the glasses should
be farther separated.</p>

<p>The adjustment of the objective by the screw-collar in the case of
the podura scale should be carried out in the way described, when the
following effects will be observed to take place, usually in the order
of their arrangement.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_207">Fig. 1</a> shows the appearance of a podura scale when the adjustment
of the object-glass is correct, and <a href="#fig_207">Fig. 2</a> shows the effect
produced on each side of the exact focus. <a href="#fig_207">Fig. 3</a> shows the way in
which the markings individually divide when all the adjustments
are correct, and when the focus is altered the least possible amount
only each way.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_207">Figs. 4</a> and <a href="#fig_207">5</a> show the two appearances on one and the other
side of the best focus when the adjustment is incorrect, <a href="#fig_207">Fig. 6</a>
showing the appearance of the same at its best focus.</p>

<p><i>The scales</i> are magnified 1,300 diameters, and each square
measures ·001 of an inch.</p>

<p>This method, however, of finding the best focus of an objective
can scarcely be accomplished without a sub-stage condenser. It may
therefore be of service to the student, and to those who are not
disposed to purchase expensive forms of condensers, to know that
either an inch or an inch and a half objective, or convex-lens mounted
on a simple wooden ring with a flange, can be arranged to slip in the
place of the diaphragm under the stage. This kind of condenser
will prove to be of considerable value with a &frac12;-inch, a <sup>4</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>-inch, and
a &frac14;-inch; while a still more excellent achromatic condenser can be
made out of a Steinheil’s <i>aplanatic-loup</i> arranged to drop into the
central fitting of the sub-stage. As without a condenser of some
kind it is hardly possible to enter upon any course of histological or
scientific research.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>

<h4><span class="smcap">Troughs&mdash;Live-cages&mdash;Compressors.</span></h4>

<p><i>A glass plate</i> with a ledge, and some pieces of <i>thin glass</i>, although
applicable for many purposes, are specially designed for objects in
fluid. Thus a drop of fluid containing the object sought for is
placed upon the slide and covered by a piece of thin glass; or,
the object being put upon the glass slide and the thin glass over
it, the fluid is applied near one side, and runs under by capillary
attraction.</p>

should also admit of being easily cleaned and repaired when broken;
matters rarely thought of by those who construct them. An early
devised <i>live-box</i> (Varley’s, <a href="#fig_208">Fig. 208</a>) consists of two circular pieces of

<p><i>The Compressorium</i> is used for similar purposes. By a graduated

for the examination of the object. Ross’s early compressorium
consists of a plate of brass about three inches long, having in its
centre a circle of glass like the bottom of the live-box. This piece
of glass is set in a frame, <i>B</i>, which slides in and out so that it can be
removed for the convenience of preparing any object upon it&mdash;under
water if desirable. The upper movable part, <i>D</i>, is attached to a screw-motion
at <i>C</i>; and at one end of the brass plate, <i>A</i>, which forms the
bed of the instrument, is an upright piece of brass grooved so as to
receive a vertical plate, to which a downward motion is given by a
single fine screw, surrounded by a spiral spring, which elevates the
plate as soon as the screw-pressure is removed.</p>

<p>Glass troughs for chara and polypes (a sectional view of one

the bottom being a thick strip, and the front (<i>a</i>)
of thinner glass than the back (<i>b</i>); the whole is
cemented together with Jeffery’s marine-glue.
The method adopted for confining objects near
the front glass varies according to circumstances. The most convenient
is to place in the trough a piece of glass wide enough to
stand across diagonally, as at <i>c</i>; then, if the object be heavier than
water, it will sink until stopped by the glass plate. At other
times, when used to view chara, the diagonal plate may be made
to press it close to the front by means of a wedge of glass or cork.
When using the trough the microscope should be placed in a nearly
horizontal position.</p>

<p>Cells for viewing living objects, and watching their movements,
take many forms, usually determined by the makers for the purposes
they are required to serve. The smaller glass troughs (Figs. 216,
216<i>a</i>) are made for examining the small infusoria, rotifers, &amp;c.,
some of which take special forms, as the double or divided trough
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
(<a href="#fig_217">Fig. 217</a>) intended for viewing the circulation of the blood in the tail
of a small fish, and at the same time keep up a supply of water and air.</p>

<p>The Frog-plate consists of a strip of plate-glass, or wood, pierced
with holes on either side, through which tapes are passed to secure
the frog in its place. At the extreme end is a shallow glass trough,
made to hold a sufficient quantity of water to keep the web of the
foot moist while under examination. In this way a continuous
view of the circulation of the blood of the animal is obtained.</p>

<p><i>Growing Cells</i> have received more attention from those who devote
attention to the lower forms of life, the
construction of which, for the purpose of
maintaining a continuous supply of fresh
water to objects under observation, and
for sustaining their vital energy for a
long period, is of some importance. The employment of live-cells
is resorted to by microscopists, as doubtless there is much to be
discovered concerning the metamorphoses which some of the lower
micro-organisms, both of plant and animal life, pass through.</p>

<p>Holman’s life slide consists of a 3 &times; 1 inch glass slide, with a
deep oval cavity in the middle to receive the specimen for observation.
A shallow oval is ground and polished around the deep cavity,
forming a bevel. From this bevel a fine cut extends, to furnish
fresh air to the living low forms of life which invariably seek the
bevelled edge of the cavity, thus bringing them within reach of the
highest powers. He also contrived a convenient form of “moist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
chamber,” or animalcule-cage (<a href="#fig_220">Fig. 220</a>), for the purpose of studying
the growth of minute organisms, without in any way disturbing
them for a lengthened period. This is also found useful as a dry
chamber for holding minute insects.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 220.&mdash;Holman’s Moist Chamber.</p></div>

<p><i>Zentmayer’s Holman Syphon Slide</i> is used either as a hot or cold
water cell. It should be deep enough to hold a small fish or newt,
and retain it without any undue pressure. When in use it is only
necessary to place the animal into it (as shown in <a href="#fig_221">Fig. 221</a>), with
some water, and secure it with a glass cover; then immerse the
upper tube in a jar of water, while another, at a lower level, maintains
a current. When the slide is on the stage of the microscope,
one jar should stand on a lower level than the other, the slide
being made the highest part of the syphon. The pressure of the
atmosphere is sufficient to keep the cover-glass in its place.</p>

<p>The examination of the various kinds of infusorial life&mdash;rotifers,
for instance&mdash;is facilitated by the addition of the smallest particle
of colouring matter, either carmine or indigo. A small quantity of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
either of these colours should be rubbed up in a little water in a
watch-glass, and a portion taken up on the point of a brush, and
the brush run along the edge of the cover-glass; sufficient will be
left behind to barely tinge the water with the colour, and this
gradually distributes itself over the rotifers. Under the microscope
this minute quantity will be seen like a rising cloud of dust, and as
it approaches a rotifer it is whirled round in different curves, showing
at once the action of its wonderfully rapid cilia. This colouring
matter appears to be devoured, as it may be traced from the mouth
to the digestive canal. Monads may be detected by this means,
and the smaller forms of <i>alg&aelig;</i>, <i>Euglena viridis</i> and <i>Protococcus
pluvialis</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Fig. 221.&mdash;Holman’s Syphon Slide.</p></div>

<p><i>Dipping-tubes.</i>&mdash;In dealing with infusorial or monad life it is
convenient to keep a stock-bottle ready for their reception, and in
a light favourable to health. When a live specimen is required for
examination, the dipping-tube is brought into requisition. These
tubes are open at both ends, and vary in length and diameter.
Their ends should be nicely rounded off in the flame of a blow-pipe;
in form either straight, or bent and drawn out to a fine point, as
represented in <a href="#fig_222">Fig. 222</a>. When any special specimen is required
for examination, then one of the tubes must be passed down into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
the water, the upper orifice having been previously closed by the
forefinger, and kept tightly pressed, until its lower orifice comes in
contact with the object. On the finger being removed, the water
rushes up and carries the creature sought for with it. The finger
is once more replaced at the top of the tube; it is then lifted
out, and the contents deposited in one or other of the glass cells
described. Tubes with india-rubber covers can be had.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 223.&mdash;Stock-bottle.</p></div></div>

<p><i>Moist and Warm Stages.</i>&mdash;In addition to the moist cells and
chambers described it is often found necessary in working out the
histories of minute organisms to keep them for some time under
observation, and as far as possible in an undisturbed condition, and
it is equally necessary to prevent evaporation of the water in which
they are immersed. One of the best warm stages is that known
as Maddox’s growing stage; this can be had of any optician. More
elaborate adaptions are required for the study of special organisms,
and for experimental research.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_224" src="images/fig_224.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 224.&mdash;Bartley’s Warm Stage.</p></div>

<p>In that case <i>Bartley’s Warm Stage</i> (<a href="#fig_224">Fig. 224</a>) is recommended.
There are other forms of warm stages in use, many of an inexpensive
kind and readily adaptable to any stage. Bartley’s has proved
useful; it consists of a vessel, <i>E</i>, three parts filled with water and
supported on a ring stand. This may be kept at any temperature
by the small spirit-lamp, <i>C</i>; a syphon tube <i>d</i> conveys the warm
water along <i>f</i>, and through the bent tubing which surrounds
the object under observation on the stage, <i>D</i>, and then passes off
through the open end, <i>C</i>, into the receptacle, <i>B</i>, placed to receive the
overflow. Steam can be used for heating, or iced water for observing
the effects of cold upon the organism.</p>

<p>A simple form of warm stage may be made of an oblong copper
plate, two inches long by one wide, from one side of which a rod of
the same material projects. The plate has a round aperture, the
centre half an inch in diameter, and is fastened to an ordinary slide
with sealing-wax. The drop or object to be examined is placed on a
large-sized cover-glass and covered over with a smaller one. Olive
oil or vaseline is painted round the edge of the smaller one to prevent
evaporation, and the preparation is placed over the aperture in the
plate. The slide bearing the copper plate is clamped to the stage of the
microscope. The flame of the spirit-lamp is applied to the extremity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
of the rod, and the heat is conducted to the plate and thence transmitted
to the specimen. In order that the temperature of the copper
plate may be approximately that of the body, the lamp is so adjusted
that a fragment of cacao butter and wax placed close to the preparation
is melted.</p>

<p>Professors Stricker and Sch&auml;fer have constructed warm stages for
accurate observations, and which fully answer every purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_225" src="images/fig_225.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 225.&mdash;Stricker’s Warm Stage.</p></div>

<p><i>Stricker’s Stage</i> (<a href="#fig_225">Fig. 225</a>) consists of a rectangular box with a
central opening, <i>C</i>, permitting the passage of light through the
specimen under examination. The water makes its exit and entrance
at the side tubes <i>B B′</i>, and the temperature is indicated by a
thermometer in front. In this apparatus either warm or cold water
can be continuously used.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_226" src="images/fig_226.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 226.&mdash;Sch&auml;fer’s Warm Stage.</p></div>

<p><i>Sch&auml;fer’s apparatus</i> (<a href="#fig_226">Fig. 226</a>) consists of a vessel filled with water
(seen near the stage) which has been first boiled to expel the air,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
and then heated by means of a gas flame. The warm water ascends
the india-rubber tubing to the brass box on the stage. The box is
pierced by a tubular aperture to admit light to the object, and has
an exit tube by which the cooled water from the stage returns by
another piece of tubing to be reheated by the gas flame. There is a
gas-regulator, by means of which any temperature can be maintained.</p>

<h3>Methods of Preparing, Hardening, Staining and
Section Cutting.</h3>

<p>Numerous methods are employed for the preparation, hardening,
staining, and section cutting of animal and vegetable tissues for
the microscope, the details of which are modified, or varied as
may be found needful, from time to time, by those whose intimate
acquaintance with the subject entitles them to make innovations
and changes in this very important department of microscopy. In
the hands of the original worker, formul&aelig; and methods will only be
regarded as finger-posts pointing out a means of saving time in
turning over pages to find this or that special method of staining.
For this particular reason I have collected all the most accredited
formul&aelig; together in an Appendix at the end of the book, and
arranged them alphabetically for ready reference.</p>

<p>As to section cutting, the student will do well to practise himself
in making dissections, thick and thin sections, of vegetable and
animal substances. The medical student will require no advice on
this point, as the use of the scalpel, and those instruments needed
for microscopical work, form an important part of his education.
Of all the instruments contrived for delicate dissections, none are
more serviceable than those which the student may make for
himself out of ordinary needles. These may be fixed in handles as
represented in <a href="#fig_229">Fig. 229</a>, in addition to which, a pair of scissors
and forceps, and a few small knives, such as those used in eye-operations,
will prove most suitable. The double-bladed scissors
represented in <a href="#fig_227">Fig. 227</a>, with curved blades, are brought into use
for cutting vegetable and other soft structures, the disadvantage
attendant upon the use of which is owing to the curvature of the
blades; when dealing with flat surfaces, the middle of the section is
left too thick to exhibit structure.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span></p>

<p>The double-bladed knife of Professor Valentin was formerly held
in high estimation by the microscopist, but this has been almost
superseded by the microtome, which has taken the place of all other
instruments, since by its aid uniform series of nearly all substances
can be cut. The standard unit of a perfect section cutter, of any
kind, has been fixed by the Royal Microscopical Society at the
one-thousandth of a millimetre.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_227" src="images/fig_227.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 227.&mdash;Section Scissors and Forceps.</p></div>

<p>The use of the razor for cutting sections has not been wholly
abandoned, the method of using which is as follows:&mdash;Take the
tissue between the thumb and finger of the left hand, hold the
finger horizontally, so that its upper surface may form a rest for the
razor to glide upon, take the razor firmly, and keep the handle in
a line with the blade, then draw it through the tissue from heel to
point and towards yourself. While cutting keep the razor well
wetted with diluted methylated spirit.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_228" src="images/fig_228.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 228.&mdash;Dissecting Knives.</p></div>

<p>Some preparation is required for cutting sections with the single
microtome. The substance to be cut must be embedded in some
other material, as carrot, turnip, potato, alder pith, paraffin, or thick
gum, with either of which the cylinder or well of the microtome
must be so nearly filled as to leave only an excavation in the centre
for the specimen to be operated upon to occupy. The various forms of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
microtomes in use, and the selection of the most suitable, is therefore a
matter of some difficulty. I must content myself by particularising
two or three typical forms in general use. As all the substances
intended for cutting require preparation, it will be first necessary to
attend to the following directions given by one experienced in section
cutting, Mr. M. J. Cole<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>:&mdash;(1) Always use fresh tissues. (2) Cut the
organs into small pieces with a sharp knife. (3) Never wash a
specimen in water; when it is necessary to remove any matter, allow
some weak salt solution to flow over the surface of the tissue, or
wash it in some hardening re-agent. (4) All specimens should be
hardened in a large quantity of the re-agent; too many pieces should
not be put into the same bottle, and keep them in a cool place.
(5) In all cases the hardening process must be completed in spirits.
(6) Label the bottles, stating the contents, the hardening fluid used,
and when changed. Attention to details is necessary, as if hardening
is neglected, good sections cannot be made.</p>

<p><i>Embedding in Paraffin Wax or Lard.</i>&mdash;Melt together, by the aid of
gentle heat, four parts of solid paraffin and one part of lard. A
quantity of this may be made and kept ready for use. Melt the
paraffin mass over a water bath, take the specimen, and dry it
between the folds of a cloth to remove the spirit, so that the paraffin
may adhere to its surface, place it in a small chip-box, in the desired
position, and pour in enough melted paraffin to cover it, then set
aside to solidify; when quite cold break away the box, and cut
sections from the embedded mass with a sharp razor.</p>

<p>To infiltrate a tissue with paraffin, place the specimen in absolute
alcohol or chloroform for an hour or two, then transfer to a bath of
melted paraffin, at its melting point (about 110&deg; F.), and keep it at
this temperature for several hours, so that the paraffin may penetrate
to the middle of the tissue. Then remove the specimen from the
paraffin and put it into a small chip-box, pour in enough paraffin to
cover it, and set aside to cool. When quite cold, make sections as
before, with a razor, or fix it into a microtome, with a little melted
paraffin. The sections when cut must be placed in turpentine to
remove the paraffin, and then into absolute alcohol to remove the
turpentine, and finally in distilled water to remove the alcohol, when
they may be forthwith stained. It is often found better to stain the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
tissue in bulk before embedding. In this case the sections will only
require the turpentine to dissolve away the paraffin, and may then
be mounted in Canada balsam.</p>

<p><i>Hardening and Preparing Animal Tissues</i> for section cutting and
microscopical examination.&mdash;Fresh tissues are not well suited for
microscopical examination, but it is sometimes advisable to observe
the appearances of a fresh specimen, especially if it is suspected to
contain amaloid bodies or parasites. It will then be necessary to
<i>tease</i> out a small portion of the tissue immersed in a weak solution
of salt and water by the aid of a pair of fine needles (<a href="#fig_229">Fig. 229</a>) and
the dissecting microscope (<a href="#fig_230">Fig. 230</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_229" src="images/fig_229.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 229.&mdash;Needles for teasing out Sections.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_230" src="images/fig_230.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 230.&mdash;Dissecting Microscope.</p></div>

<p>The most important point in connection with an instrument of
this kind is, that it affords firm and convenient rests for the hands,
and should not be raised too high from the table.</p>

<p>The stage should either be made of glass, or provided with a glass
dish for dissecting under water, or preservative fluid. A pair of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
aplanatic lenses, mounted on a focussing bar as shown in <a href="#fig_230">Fig. 230</a>,
will be found the most convenient to work with.</p>

<p>Investigations of this nature should be always carried out in the
manner described, but preparations of the kind cannot be preserved
any length of time, unless properly hardened in spirit or Formalin
solution. The method of teasing out under the light of a condensing
lens is shown in <a href="#fig_231">Fig. 231</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_231" src="images/fig_231.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 231.&mdash;Method of teasing out Muscular Fibre, &amp;c., in a fluid
medium under Condensed Light.</p></div>

<p>It may be as well to state at the outset that physiological and
pathological tissues can be hardened by immersion in methylated
spirit alone, or a saturated solution of picric acid in methylated spirit
in about a week, and it is said to yield satisfactory results, even some
of the tissues being ready in twenty-four hours. The only drawback
is that sections thus quickly hardened must be stained with picro-carmine.
But, whatever method of hardening adopted, the tissue
should be washed by means of a stream of water for half an hour, to
remove all traces of the hardening agent, and on its removal pressed
between folds of cotton cloth or fine Swedish filtering paper.</p>

<p>The principal hardening re-agents usually kept in bulk ready for
use are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Absolute Alcohol.</i>&mdash;This is suitable for the internal organs of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
animals, glands, &amp;c. These organs must be perfectly fresh, and
should be cut into small pieces, so that the alcohol may penetrate
them as quickly as possible. The hardening is usually complete in
a short time.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p><i>Chromic Acid and Spirit.</i>&mdash;Chromic acid one-sixth per cent., water
solution two parts, and methylated spirit one part. This reagent
hardens in about ten days. Then transfer to methylated spirit,
which should be changed every day until all colour is discharged
from the tissue. This is a suitable reagent for the preparation of
cartilage, nerve trunks, heart, lips, blood vessels, trachea, lungs,
tongue, intestines, and gullet.</p>

<p><i>Potassium Bichromate.</i>&mdash;-Make a two per cent. water solution of this
salt. This will harden specimens in about three weeks. Then
transfer the preparation to methylated spirit, and change it every
day until all colour is discharged. This is suitable for spinal cord,
medulla, cerebellum, and cerebrum.</p>

<p><i>M&uuml;ller’s Fluid.</i>&mdash;Bichromate of potash 30 grains, sulphate of
soda 15 grains, distilled water 3&frac12; ounces. This hardens in from
three to six weeks. Then transfer, as before, to methylated spirits,
and change it every day until colour ceases to appear. Most suitable
for lymphatic glands, eye-ball and its internal structures, as well as
for tendons, and thymus gland.</p>

<p><i>Methylated Spirit</i> may be generally employed, but it has a
tendency to shrink some tissues too much; it hardens in about ten
days. It is usual to change the spirit daily, for the first three days
at least. Skin, mammary gland, supra-renal glands, tonsils, and all
injected organs may be hardened in it. (See note on the adulteration
of methylated spirit with rack-oil, which utterly spoils it
for use.)</p>

<p><i>Decalcifying solution</i> for bones and teeth. Take one-sixth per cent.
watery solution of chromic acid, and to every measured ounce add five
drops of nitric acid. This reagent will soften the femur of any
small animal in about three weeks; larger require a longer time.
Change the fluid several times, and test its action by running a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
needle through the thickest part of the bone. Should it not pass
through easily, then continue the process until it does. When soft
enough transfer to water, let it soak for an hour or two, then pour
off the water and add ten per cent. solution of carbonate of soda, and
soak for twelve hours to remove all trace of acid. Wash again in
water, and transfer to methylated spirit until required. Teeth
require a large quantity of the decalcifying solution for softening.</p>

<p><i>Microtomes.</i>&mdash;The simplest form of “hand-cutting machine” is
that worked by a screw, which raises the preparation, and at the
same time regulates the fineness of the section. When a number of
sections are required, or when a complete series of sections of an
organ is desired, Cole’s simple microtome (<a href="#fig_233">Fig. 233</a>) is in every way
adapted.</p>

<div class="table">

<p class="caption">Fig. 233.&mdash;Cole’s Section Cutting
Microtome.</p></div></div>

<p><i>The method of using it</i> is as follows:&mdash;Screw the microtome firmly
to the table, and with the brass tube supplied with the microtome,
punch out a cylinder of carrot to fit into the well. Cut this in half
longitudinally, and scrape out enough space in one half of the carrot
to take the specimen; then place the other half of carrot in position,
and make sure that the specimen is held firmly between them, but
it must not be crushed. Now put the cylinder of carrot and specimen
into the well of the microtome and commence cutting the section.
A good razor will do, but it is better to use the knife which Messrs.
Watson supply with the microtome. While cutting keep the knife
and plate of the microtome well wetted with dilute methylated spirit,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
and as sections are cut place them in a saucer of dilute spirit. A
number of sections may be cut and preserved in methylated spirit
until required for examination or mounting.</p>

<p>When a specimen has a very irregular outline, it cannot be very
successfully embedded in carrot; paraffin will then be found to be
more suitable. Place the tissue in the well of the microtome in the
proper position, pour in enough melted paraffin to cover it, and put
it by to get cold and hard before attempting to cut sections.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_234" src="images/fig_234.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 234.&mdash;The Cambridge Rocking Microtome.</p></div>

<p><i>Cambridge Rocking Microtome.</i>&mdash;This new pattern Cambridge
Rocking Microtome (<a href="#fig_234">Fig. 234</a>) possesses advantages over other instruments
in use for cutting flat sections, and not parts of a cylindrical
surface. The tube containing the paraffin is 30 millimetres in internal
diameter instead of 20 millimetres, as in the earlier forms. The
forward movement is also increased, so that an object 12 millimetres
long can be cut throughout its whole length. It is provided with a
dividing arc for reading off the thickness of the section in thousandths
of a millimetre. The razor may be fixed either with its edge at
right angles to the direction of motion of the object, or diagonally,
for giving a slicing cut. The object can also be raised and fixed in
position clear of the razor.</p>

<p>This microtome has both steadiness and stiffness in its geometrical
arrangement and bearings, while the simplicity and efficiency of its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
mechanism for advancing the section between each stroke of the
razor is remarkable. Although it may appear more complicated at
first sight, it is found not to be so when brought into use.</p>

<p><i>Cathcart’s Freezing Microtome.</i>&mdash;This is a convenient and useful
microtome for freezing purposes. Since its first introduction it has
been much improved. The clamping arrangements give steadiness,
and the principal screw is more effective; the freezing-plate is
circular, and the arrangements made for preventing the ether from
reaching the upper plate secures the object in view. This instrument
can now be used for embedding as well as freezing. The
directions for freezing are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Place a few drops of mucilage (one part gum to three parts
water) on the zinc plate.</p>

<p>2. Take a piece of the tissue to be cut, of about a quarter of an
inch in thickness, and press it into the gum.</p>

<p>3. Fill the ether bottle with anhydrous methylated ether, and
push the spray points into their socket. All spirit must of course
have been previously removed by soaking for a night in water. The
tissue should afterwards be soaked in gum for a like time before
being cut.</p>

<p>Work the spray bellows briskly until the gum begins to freeze;
after this work more gently. Be always careful to brush off the
frozen vapour which, in a moist atmosphere, may collect below the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
zinc plate. If the ether should tend to collect in drops below the
plate, work the bellows slower.</p>

<p>5. Raise the tissue by turning the milled head, and cut by sliding
the knife along the glass plates.</p>

<p>6. After use, be careful to wipe the whole instrument clean.</p>

<p>7. Should the ether point become choked, clear by means of the
fine wire provided for the purpose.</p>

<p>8. The instrument is intended for use with methylated sulphuric
ether.</p>

<p>9. In clamping the instrument to a table, or other support, care
should be taken that the zinc plate is in a horizontal position. If
the plate be not horizontal, the gum will tend to run to one side.</p>

<p>The arrangement made for cutting and embedding sections consists
of a cylindrical tube (<a href="#fig_235">Fig. 235</a><i>a</i>) fitting into the principal well of
the microtome, within which is a hinged plate, upon which the screw
acts, as in an ordinary vice. To bring this into use the freezing
apparatus must be first removed, and the embedding tube placed in
the well, and firmly pressed into place.</p>

<h3>Staining Animal Structures.</h3>

<p>Specific stains are chiefly employed to assist the eye in
distinguishing one elementary tissue from another. It is therefore
necessary to stain all structures, as certain parts are seen to have
a special affinity for one colouring agent rather than another, whereby
they become more deeply stained, and consequently more clearly
differentiated. For staining animal structures, borax, carmine, and
h&aelig;matoxylin are more frequently employed than others. The
formul&aelig; for each will be found in the Appendix “Formul&aelig; and
Methods.”</p>

<p><i>Staining Process.</i>&mdash;Place the section in distilled water to wash
away the alcohol; place a little of the carmine in a watch glass, and
immerse the section in it for four or five minutes; then remove it to
a solution composed of methylated spirit five parts, hydrochloric acid
one part; shake well together. This solution should be kept ready
for use. Immerse the section in this solution and leave it to soak
for about five or ten minutes if over-stained, until the desired tint
has been obtained. Sections of skin and fibrous tissue may be left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
until nearly all colour is removed, the glands and hair follicles will
then be brought out more clearly. The section must be transferred
to methylated spirit to remove all traces of acid, then to
oil of cloves contained in a watch glass, lift the section from the
methylated spirit by one of the <i>lifters</i> (<a href="#fig_250">Fig. 250</a>), and carefully float
it on the oil, in which it should be allowed to remain for about five
minutes. This is the clearing process, the object of which is to
remove the spirit and prepare the section for mounting in Canada
balsam. First, however, place the section in filtered turpentine to
wash away the oil of cloves; this is found to answer better than
another plan adopted, that of removing the section from the oil of
cloves and mounting it in balsam direct. The oil, however, has a
tendency to darken the balsam.</p>

<p><i>Logwood or H&aelig;matoxylin Stains</i> (<a href="#APPENDIX">see Appendix</a> for the several
formul&aelig;). Staining by this agent is effected as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>After the specimen has been hardened in any of the chromic acid
solutions in use, transfer it to a seven per cent. watery solution of
bicarbonate of soda for about five minutes, then wash well in
distilled water. Spirit prepared preparations do not require to be
transferred to the soda solution, but all sections must be washed
before they are transferred to the logwood stain. To a watch glass
nearly full of distilled water add ten or twenty drops of the
logwood stain, in which it should remain for twenty or thirty minutes.
Wash well with the ordinary tap water, which will fix the dye and
cause it to become blue. Dehydrate in methylated spirit, clear in
clove oil, and mount in dammar or Canada balsam.</p>

<p><i>Double-staining with H&aelig;matoxylin and Rosin.</i>&mdash;Stain the section
as directed above, then place it in an alcoholic solution of rosin,
about one gramme of rosin to an ounce of methylated spirit, and let
it soak for a few minutes; wash well in methylated spirit, clear in
oil of cloves, and mount in balsam.</p>

<p><i>Canada balsam</i> should be prepared for use as follows:&mdash;One ounce
of dried balsam to one fluid ounce of pure benzole; dissolve, and keep
in an <i>outside</i> stoppered bottle. Clear the section in clove oil, and
place it in turpentine, clean a cover-glass and slide, place a few
drops of balsam on the centre of the latter, take the section from
the turpentine on a <i>lifter</i>, allow the excess of turpentine to drain
away, and with a needle-point lift the section on to the balsam slide.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
Now take up the cover-glass with a pair of forceps (<a href="#fig_236">Fig. 236</a>), and
bring its edge in contact with the balsam, ease it down carefully as
shown in <a href="#fig_237">Fig. 237</a>, so that no air bubbles are enclosed, and with
the needle point press the surface of the cover until the section lies
quite smoothly and flat, and the excess of balsam is pressed out.
The slide should now be transferred to the <i>warm-chamber</i>, and
there allowed to remain for a day or two, or until set and hardened.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_236" src="images/fig_236.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 236.&mdash;Forceps for Mounting.</p></div>

<p>Any exuded balsam may be washed away with benzole and a soft
camel’s hair brush; then dry the slide with an old piece of linen
cloth, and apply a ring of cement or Japanner’s gold size. Other
methods for staining and mounting will be found to answer quite as
well&mdash;that of Beneke’s is a useful one for staining connective tissue.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_237" src="images/fig_237.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 237.&mdash;Mode of placing Glass Cover on Object.</p></div>

<p>For staining connective tissue a modification of Weigert’s method
of staining fibrine is resorted to. Portions of tissue that have been
fixed in alcohol having been embedded in paraffin and cut, the
sections are detached and placed on glass slides, and stained for ten
or twenty minutes with gentian violet, ten parts, well shaken with
water 100 parts; filter, and add five to ten parts of a concentrated
alcoholic gentian violet solution. Afterwards treat for one minute
with lugol solution, of a port wine tint, dry with filter paper and
decolourise with aniline xylol (aniline oil two parts and xylol three
parts). Decolourisation having been stopped at the right point (judged
from experience) mount the sections in xylol balsam. The fibres of
the connective tissue should appear stained of various shades of violet.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>

<p><i>Double Staining</i> nucleated blood corpuscles. Two kinds of
staining agents are required. Stain A: dissolve five grammes of rosin
in half an ounce of distilled water, and add half an ounce of
rectified alcohol. Stain B: dissolve five grammes of methyl green in
an ounce of distilled water. Place a drop of frog’s blood on a glass
slide, and with the edge of another slide spread it evenly over the
centre of the slip, and put it away to dry; when quite dry flood the
slide with stain A for three minutes, and wash with water, now flood
the slide with Stain B for five minutes, wash again with water, and
allow the slide to dry. Apply a drop of the prepared Canada
balsam and a cover-glass.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_238" src="images/fig_238.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 238.&mdash;Shadbolt’s Turn-table.</p></div>

<p>The blood of such mammals as are non-nucleated should be treated
in a slightly different way. Spread a drop or two of blood on a
slide and dry it quickly; then put the slide on Shadbolt’s turn-table
(<a href="#fig_238">Fig. 238</a>) and run a ring of cement around it; allow this time to dry,
and then apply a second coating, and before this becomes quite dry
place on it a clean glass cover, and press it down gently with one of
the fine needles (<a href="#fig_229">Fig. 229</a>), until firmly adherent.</p>

<p><i>Epithelium</i>.&mdash;Remove from the mouth of a frog by scraping some
<i>squamous</i> epithelium; the columnar must be taken from the stomach;
place it in glycerine, or Farrant’s solution on the slide; apply a
cover-glass, and with the point of the needle press it down until the
epithelium cells are separated and spread evenly over the slide. Set
this aside for a day or two, then wash away any of the medium
which may have escaped; dry the slide, and run a ring of cement
around the edges, on the turn-table. Portions of the intestine of a
rabbit or other animal may be treated in the same way. If it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
wished to make permanent specimens of such structures, the
intestine must be hardened in a two per cent. solution of bichromate
of potash for a couple of days, then washed until all colour is
discharged, and removed to a solution of picro-carmine for twenty-four
hours, after which allow the stain to drain away, when it will be
ready for mounting.</p>

<p>By the aid of the handy little spring clip (<a href="#fig_239">Fig. 239</a>), objects of
delicacy when mounted may be left to dry and harden for any
length of time.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_239" src="images/fig_239.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 239.&mdash;Spring-clip for Mounting.</p></div>

<p><i>Striped muscular fibre</i>, taken from the pig, must be teased out in
a two per cent. solution of bichromate of potash, in which it should
remain for two or three weeks, when it may be transferred to
methylated spirit, and allowed to remain until required for mounting.
Soak a piece in water to remove the spirit, place a small fragment
on a slide in a few drops of
water, and with a couple of
needles tease the tissue up,
so as to separate the fibres.
Drain away the water, and
apply a drop or two of
Farrant’s medium and a cover-glass, which cement down as before
directed.</p>

<p><i>Fibrous tissue</i> may be served in the same way. <i>Yellow elastic
tissue</i> must be first placed in a solution of chromic acid and spirit
for ten days, and then treated as directed for muscular fibre.</p>

<p><i>Non-striated Muscle.</i>&mdash;A piece of the intestine of a rabbit should
be steeped in chromic acid and spirit for ten days, then washed in
water; strip off a thin layer of the muscular coat, and stain in
h&aelig;matoxylin solution. Well wash in ordinary water until the
colour changes to blue, when it will be fit for mounting. Place a
fragment on a slide and a drop of water, and carefully separate the
fibres with a pair of needles. Drain off the water, as it is now
ready for mounting, place on slide, and add a drop or two of
Farrant’s medium, and place on the cover-glass.</p>

<p><i>Nerve Tissue.</i>&mdash;Dissect out the large sciatic nerve from a frog’s
thigh, and stretch it on a small piece of wood, to which pin both
ends of the nerve, and transfer it to a one per cent. solution of osmic
acid for an hour or two. Wash in distilled water; tease up a small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
fragment on a slide (as shown in <a href="#fig_240">Fig. 240</a>), and apply a drop or two
of Farrant’s solution and cover-glass.</p>

<p>Tissues containing air should be soaked in water that has been
boiled for ten minutes; this will displace the air. (For Farrant’s
medium, <a href="#APPENDIX">see Appendix.</a>)</p>

<p><i>Glycerine Jelly.</i>&mdash;Dissolve one ounce of French gelatine in six
ounces of distilled water, and melt together in a hot-water bath.
When quite dissolved, add four ounces of glycerine, and a few drops
of creosote or carbolic acid. Filter through white filtering paper
while warm, and keep in a capped bottle. This may be used instead
of Farrant’s solution.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_240" src="images/fig_240.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 240.&mdash;Method of Teasing out Tissue.</p></div>

<p><i>Nitrate of silver</i> darkens by exposure; it is used in a half per
cent. watery solution. Specimens to be acted upon should be
washed in distilled water, to remove every trace of sodium chloride,
and then steeped in the silver solution for some two or three
minutes, after which they should be again washed until they cease to
turn milky; then place them in glycerine and expose them to the
action of light until they assume a dark brown colour, when they
should be mounted in glycerine or glycerine jelly.</p>

<p>By means of this stain the endothelial cells of the lymphatics,
blood vessels, &amp;c., and the nodes of Ranvier, constrictions in
medullary nerves, are rendered visible. Sections of any of these
may subsequently be stained by logwood or carmine.</p>

<p>Several methods have been adopted for staining with gold chloride.
Dr. Klein’s and Professor Sch&auml;fer’s are among the best.</p>

<p>Dr. Klein’s method of showing the nerves of the cornea is as
follows:&mdash;Remove the cornea within fifteen minutes of death;
place it in a half per cent. chloride of gold solution for half an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
hour, or an hour; wash in distilled water, and expose to the light
for a few days; in the meantime occasionally change the water.
Then immerse it in glycerine and distilled water, in the proportion
of one to two; lastly, place it in water, and brush gently
with a sable pencil to remove any precipitate, when it will be fit
for mounting in glycerine. The colour of the cornea should be
grey-violet.</p>

<p>Sch&auml;fer adopts another method&mdash;a double chloride of gold and
potassium solution.</p>

<p>Osmic acid, first used by Schultze, is useful for the demonstration
of fatty matters, all of which it colours black; it is also valuable
for certain nerve preparations. Specimens should be allowed to
remain in a one or two per cent. aqueous solution of the acid from
a quarter to twenty-four hours, when the staining will be completed;
but if it is desired to harden specimens at the same time, they
should remain in it for some few days. Osmic acid does not penetrate
very deeply, therefore small portions should be selected for
immersion. This is a useful stain for infusorial animals.</p>

<p>Chloride of palladium, another of Schultze’s staining fluids, is
used to stain and harden the retina, crystalline lens, and other
tissues of the eye, the cornified fat and connective tissues remaining
uncoloured. The solution should be used very weak:&mdash;Chloride of
palladium, one part; distilled water, 1,000 parts. Specimens should
be mounted in glycerine at once, or further stained with carmine.</p>

<p>Dr. Sch&auml;fer employs a silver nitrate and gelatine solution for
demonstrating lung epithelium; this is made as follows:&mdash;Take of
gelatine ten grammes, soak in cold water, dissolve, and add warm water
to 100 cc. Dissolve a decigramme of nitrate of silver in a little
distilled water, and add to the gelatine solution. Inject this with a
glass syringe into the lung until distension is pretty complete.
Leave it to rest in a cool place until the gelatine has set; then cut
sections as thin as possible, place them on a slide with glycerine, and
expose to light till ready for mounting.</p>

<p>Of the double stains Mr. Groves prefers only those where the
double colour is produced by a single process&mdash;or stains in which
one colour is first employed, and then another. Single stains
are picro-carmine, carmine and indigo carmine, aniline blue and
aniline red.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span></p>

<p>Picro-carmine is specially useful for staining sections hardened in
picric acid. It is prepared in several ways:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Add to a saturated solution of picric acid in water a strong
solution of carmine in ammonia to saturation.</p>

<p>2. Evaporate the mixture to one-fifth its bulk over a water bath,
allow it to cool, filter from deposit, and evaporate to dryness, when
picro-carmine is left as a crystalline powder of red-ochre colour.</p>

<p>Sections can be stained in a one per cent. aqueous solution, requiring
only ten minutes for the process; wash well in distilled water, and
transfer them to methylated alcohol, then to absolute alcohol, after
which they are rendered transparent by immersing in oil of cloves
or benzole, before mounting in balsam or dammar.</p>

<p>To summarise Mr. Groves’ recommendations:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Let the material be quite fresh.</p>

<p>2. (<i>a</i>) Take care that the hardening or softening fluid is not too
strong. (<i>b</i>) Use a large bulk of fluid in proportion to the material.
(<i>c</i>) Change the fluid frequently. (<i>d</i>) If freezing be employed, take
care that the specimen is thoroughly frozen.</p>

<p>3. (<i>a</i>) Always use a sharp razor. (<i>b</i>) Take it with one diagonal
sweep through the material. (<i>c</i>) Make the sections as thin as possible;
and (<i>d</i>) Remove each one as soon as cut, for if sections
accumulate on the knife or razor they are sure to get torn.</p>

<p>4. (<i>a</i>) Do not be in a hurry to stain, but (<i>b</i>) Remember that a
weak colouring solution permeates the section better, and produces
the best results; and (<i>c</i>) That the thinner the section the better it
will take the stains.</p>

<p>5. (<i>a</i>) Always use glass slips and covers free from scratches and
bubbles, and chemically clean. (<i>b</i>) Never use any but extra thin
circular covers, so that the specimens may be used with high
powers. (<i>c</i>) Always use cold preservatives, except in the case of
glycerine jelly, and never use warmth to hasten the drying of
balsam or dammar, but run a ring of cement round the cover.</p>

<p>6. Label specimens correctly; keep them in a flat tray, and in
the dark.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span></p>

<h3>Double and Treble Staining.</h3>

<p>Dr. W. Stirling<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> furnishes a brief but useful account of the
methods he has employed with much success.</p>

<p><i>Osmic Acid and Picro-carmine.</i>&mdash;Mix on a glass slide a drop of
the blood of newt or frog and a drop of a one per cent. aqueous solution
of osmic acid, and allow the slide to stand by. This will fix the
corpuscles without altering their shape. At the end of five minutes
remove any excess of acid with blotting-paper, add a drop of a solution
of picro-carmine, and a trace of glycerine to prevent evaporation,
and set aside for three or four hours to see that no overstaining takes
place. At the end of this time the nucleus will be found to be
stained red, and the perinuclear part yellow.</p>

<p><i>Picric Acid and Picro-carmine.</i>&mdash;Place a drop of the blood of a
frog or newt on a glass slide, and add a drop of a saturated solution
of picric acid: put the slide aside and allow it to remain for five
minutes; at the end of that time, when the acid has fixed the
corpuscles (that is, coagulated their contents), any excess of acid
should be removed as before. A drop of solution of picro-carmine
should now be added, and a trace of glycerine, and the preparation
set aside for an hour. At the end of that time remove the picro-carmine
solution by means of a narrow slip of blotting-paper, and add
a drop of Farrant’s solution of glycerine and apply glass-cover. The
perinuclear part of the corpuscles will be seen to be highly granular
and of a deep orange colour, whilst the nucleus is stained red. Some
of the corpuscles will appear of a delicate yellow colour, and threads
are seen extending from the nucleus to the envelopes. The preparation
should be preserved and mounted in glycerine.</p>

<p><i>Picro-carmine and Aniline Dye.</i>&mdash;For glandular tissue, none of
the aniline dyes answer so well as iodine green, used in the form of
a one per cent. watery solution. Stain the tissue in picro-carmine,
wash it in distilled water acidulated with acetic acid, and stain it in
a solution of iodine green. As it acts rapidly, care must be taken
not to overstain. Wash the section in water, and then transfer it
to alcohol; finally clear with oil of cloves. The washing should be
done rapidly, as the spirit dissolves out the green dye. All preparations
stained with iodine green must be mounted in dammar.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

<p><i>Picro-carmine and Iodine Green.</i>&mdash;Stain a section of the cancellated
head of a very young bone (fœtal bone) in picro-carmine, wash it in
distilled water, and stain it with iodine green, and mount in dammar.
All newly-formed bone is stained red; that in the centre of the
osseous trabecul&aelig;, the residue of the calcified cartilage in which the
bone is deposited, is stained green. Many of the bone corpuscles are
also stained green.</p>

<p>Ossifying cartilage, the back part of the tongue, Peyer’s Patches,
solitary-glands, trachea, and bronchus, may all be treated in the same
way. In preparing the skin, take a vertical section from the sole of
the foot of a fœtus. The cuticle and superficial layers of the epithelium
are dyed yellow, the rete Malpighii green; and the continuation
of these cells can be traced into the ducts of the sweat-glands, which
are green, and form a marked contrast to the red stained connective
tissue of the cutis vera, through which they have to ascend to reach
the surface. The outer layer of the grey matter of the cerebellum
with Purkinge’s cells is, when double stained, red, while the inner or
granular layer is green. Logwood and iodine green stains the mucous
glands of the tongue green, and the serous glands, lilac logwood
stain.</p>

<p><i>Eosin and Iodine Green.</i>&mdash;Eosin is used as the ground colour.
Stain the tissue in an alcoholic solution of eosin, which will colour it
very rapidly, usually in a few seconds. Wash the section thoroughly
in water acidulated with acetic or hydrochloric acid, a one per cent.
solution, and stain with iodine green. This will double stain bone
and cerebellum; but if logwood is substituted for the latter, the
cerebrum and general substance become stained by the eosin, while
the logwood colours the nerve-cells a lilac.</p>

<p><i>Gold Chloride and Aniline Dyes.</i>&mdash;The tissue must be impregnated
with chloride of gold, and then stained with either aniline blue,
iodine green, or rosin. The tail of a young rat, containing as it
does so many different structures, is an excellent material for experimenting
upon. Remove the skin from the tail, and place pieces half
an inch long into the juice of a fresh lemon for five minutes, wash it
to get rid of the acid. The fine tendons swell up under the action
of the lemon acid, and permit of the more ready action of the chloride
of gold solution. Place the piece for an hour or more in a one per
cent. solution of gold, remove it and wash it thoroughly, and then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
place it in a twenty-five per cent. solution of formic acid for twenty-four
hours. This reduces the gold. During the process of reduction the
preparation must be kept in the dark. The osseous portion has then
to be decalcified in the ordinary way, with a mixture of chromic and
nitric acid. After decalcification preserve the whole in alcohol.
Transverse sections of the decalcified tail are made, and may be
stained with a red dye, as rosin, and afterwards with a watery
solution of iodine green. Mount in dammar.</p>

<h3>Injecting Small Animal Bodies.</h3>

<img id="fig_242" src="images/fig_242.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 242.&mdash;Water Bath and Melting
Vessels.</p></div></div>

<p>The injection of animal bodies practised by the older anatomists,
to render the vascular system more apparent, has not been superseded
by the more modern methods of staining. The method of injecting
even small bodies requires some skill, and a few pieces of apparatus
made expressly for the purpose. First, a special form of brass
syringe of such a size that it may be grasped with the right hand,
the thumb at the same time covering the button at the top of the
piston-rod when drawn out to the full. In <a href="#fig_241">Fig. 241</a> the piston rod
is seen withdrawn, <i>a</i> is the body, with a screw at the top for firmly
screwing down the cover, <i>b</i>, after the piston, <i>c</i>, is replaced; <i>e</i> is
a stop-cock, to the end of which either of the smaller cannul&aelig;, <i>g</i>, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
affixed. The transverse wires are for securing them tightly with
thread to the vessels into which they are to be inserted. In addition
to the syringe, two or three tinned vessels are required to contain
size, injecting fluid, and hot water.</p>

<p>The size must be kept hot by the aid of a water bath; if a naked
fire be used there is danger of burning it. A convenient form of
apparatus for melting the size, and afterwards keeping it at a proper
temperature, is <a href="#fig_242">Fig. 242</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_243" src="images/fig_243.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 243.&mdash;Artery Needle.</p></div>

<p>A pair of strong forceps for seizing the vessel, and a small needle
(<a href="#fig_243">Fig. 243</a>) is also necessary for passing the thread round the vessel into
which the injection pipe has been inserted. These complete the list
of apparatus. To prepare the material for opaque injections, take one
pound of the finest and most transparent glue, break it into small
pieces, put it into an earthen pot, and pour on it three pints of cold
water; let it stand twenty-four hours, stirring it now and then with
a stick; set it over a slow fire for half an hour, or until all the pieces
are perfectly dissolved, skim off the froth from the surface, and
strain through a flannel for use. Isinglass and cuttings of parchment
make an excellent size, and are preferable for particular injections.
If gelatine be employed an ounce to a pint of water will be sufficiently
strong, but in very hot weather it is necessary to add a little more
gelatine. It must be first soaked in part of the cold water until it
swells up and becomes soft, when the rest of the water, made hot,
is to be added. The size thus prepared may be fixed with finely
levigated vermilion, chrome-yellow, blue salts, or flake white.</p>

<p>To prepare the subject, the principal points to be attained are: to
dissolve the fluids and completely empty the vessels; relax the
solids; and prevent the injection from coagulating too soon. For
this purpose it is necessary to place the animal, or part to be
injected, in warm water, as hot as the operator’s hand will bear.
This should be kept at nearly the same temperature for some time
by occasionally adding hot water. The length of time required is in
proportion to the size of the part and the amount of its rigidity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>

<p><i>Injecting the systems of Vessels with different colours: Carmine
and Gelatine Injection.</i>&mdash;Carmine 30 grains, strong liquid ammonia
60 drops, glacial acetic acid 43 drops, gelatine solution (one ounce
in six ounces of water) two ounces, water one ounce: dissolve the
carmine in the ammonia and water in a test tube, and mix it with
one half of the warm gelatine, add the acid to the remaining half of
gelatine, and drop it little by little into the carmine mixture, stirring
it well with a glass rod during the mixing; filter through flannel,
and add a few drops of carbolic acid to make it keep. It is very
important that the stain should be quite <i>neutral</i>, the test of which
is the colour and smell of the fluid. It should be a bright red, and
all trace of smell of ammonia must be removed.</p>

<p><i>Prussian or Berlin Blue and Gelatine.</i>&mdash;Take 1&frac12; ounces of
gelatine, place it in a vessel and cover it with water; allow it to
stand until all the water is absorbed and the gelatine is quite soft,
then dissolve in hot water. Dissolve one drachm (60 grains) of
Prussian or Berlin blue in six ounces of water, and gradually mix it
with the gelatine solution, stirring well with a glass rod during the
mixing; then filter as before.</p>

<p><i>Watery Solution of Berlin Blue.</i>&mdash;Dissolve 2&frac12; drachms of the blue
in 18 ounces of distilled water, and filter. This staining fluid is
used for injecting the lymphatic system.</p>

<p><i>Directions for Injecting.</i>&mdash;The animal to be injected must be first
killed by chloroform, and injected while still warm; to secure this
place the body in a water bath, at a temperature of 104&deg; Fahrenheit.
Expose the main artery of the parts to be injected, clear a small
portion of it from the surrounding tissues, and place a ligature of thin
tissue or silk round it, by means of the small artery needle (<a href="#fig_243">Fig. 243</a>).
With a pair of sharp-pointed scissors make an oblique slit in the
wall of the vessel, insert the cannula, and tie the ligature firmly
over the artery behind the point of the cannula, into which put the
stop-cock. Fill the syringe with injection fluid, which must not be
too warm, and take care not to draw up any air-bubbles; insert the
nozzle of the syringe into the stop-cock and force in a little fluid;
remove the syringe so that the air may escape, re-insert the syringe,
repeat the process until no air-bubbles escape, and then proceed
slowly with the injection. Half an hour will be required to complete
the process in an animal the size of a rabbit. To judge of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
completeness of the injection, examine the vascular parts of the
lips, tongues and eyes; if satisfactory, tie the ligature round the
artery and withdraw the syringe; place the animal in cold water for
an hour to consolidate the injection fluid. When cold dissect out
the organs, cut them up, and place them in methylated spirit to
harden. Change the spirit every twenty-four hours for the first
three days. The hardening process will be complete in ten days.</p>

<p>To inject lymphatics by the puncture process, a small-sized
subcutaneous syringe should be used, filled with a watery solution
of the prepared stains. Thrust the nozzle into the pad of the foot,
(or tongue), and then rub the limb to cause the injection fluid to flow
along the lymphatic vessels into the glands.</p>

<p>When the blue stain is used add a few drops of acetic acid to the
spirit while the hardening process is going on.</p>

<p><i>Of Injecting Different Systems of Vessels with Different Colours.</i>&mdash;It
is often desirable to inject different systems of vessels distributed
to a part with different colours, in order to ascertain the arrangement
of each set of vessels and their relation to each other. A portion of
the gall-bladder in which the veins have been injected with white
lead, and the arteries with vermilion, forms an attractive preparation.
Each artery, even to its smallest branches, is seen to be accompanied
by two small veins, one lying on either side of it. By this method
four different sets of tubes have been injected&mdash;the artery with
vermilion, the portal vein with white lead, the duct with Prussian
blue, and the hepatic vein with lake. There are also opaque
colouring matters which may be employed for double injections.</p>

<p><i>Injecting the Lower Animals.</i>&mdash;The vessels of fishes are exceedingly
tender, and require great caution in filling them. It is often
difficult or quite impossible to tie the pipe in the vessel of a fish,
and it will generally be found a much easier process to cut off the
tail of the fish, and put the pipe into the divided vessel which lies
immediately beneath the spinal column. In this simple manner
beautiful injections of fish may be made.</p>

<p><i>Mollusca</i> (slug, snail, oyster, &amp;c.).&mdash;The tenuity of the vessels
of the mollusc often renders it impossible to tie the pipe in the
usual manner. The capillaries are, however, usually very large, so
that the injection runs very readily. In different parts of the bodies
of these animals are numerous lacun&aelig; or spaces, which communicate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
directly with the vessels. Now, if an opening be made through the
integument of the muscular foot of the animal, a pipe may be
inserted, and thus the vessels may be injected from these lacun&aelig;
with comparative facility.</p>

<p><i>Insects.</i>&mdash;Injections of insects may be made by forcing the
injection into the general abdominal cavity, when it passes into the
dorsal vessel and is afterwards distributed throughout the system.
The superfluous injection is then washed away, and such parts of the
body as may be required removed for examination.</p>

<p>Natural injection of Medus&aelig; may be effected without injuring the
vessels, with an opening at the side remote from it. The medusa
must be placed in a glass vessel, with the bell downwards, and a
bell-jar ending in a narrow tube above is placed over it and made
air-tight; the medusa is then covered with the injection-mass, the
air in the glass is exhausted, and as the sea-water runs out by slits
in the lower side of the annular canal, the coloured fluid runs in.
In the case of leeches and large species of earthworms, the natural
injection is made from the ventral sinus. In all cases a glass tube
is used, with a finely drawn-out point. The injection is complete
when the injection issues from the counter-opening. Besides the
animals mentioned, large caterpillars, beetles, and larv&aelig; of various
kinds are favourable objects for injection; the glass cannula being
introduced into the posterior end of the dorsal vessel, and the
counter-opening made in the ventral vessel, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

<p><i>Staining Living Protoplasm with Bismarck Brown.</i>&mdash;Henneguy
having treated <i>Paramœcium aurelia</i> with an aqueous solution of
aniline brown (known as “Bismarck Brown”), found that they
assumed an intense yellow-brown colour. The colour first appears
in the vacuoles of the protoplasm, and then in the protoplasm itself,
the nucleus generally remaining colourless, and becoming more
visible than in the normal state. If a yellow-tinted paramœcium
be compressed so as to cause a small quantity of the protoplasm to
exude, it is seen that it really is the protoplasmic substance which
becomes coloured. All the Infusoria may be stained with Bismarck
brown, but no other aniline colour employed exhibits the same
property&mdash;they merely stain the Infusoria after death, and are in fact
poisonous. Living protoplasm does not as a rule absorb colouring
matters, and as Infusoria are chiefly composed of protoplasm,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
attempts have been made to ascertain whether protoplasm in general,
of animal or vegetable origin, behaved in the same way in the
presence of aniline brown. A tolerably strong solution of Bismarck
brown was therefore injected under the skin of the back of several
frogs. After some hours the tissues became uniformly tinted a deep
yellow; the muscular substance especially had a very marked yellow
tint. The frogs did not appear in the least incommoded. Small
fry of trout placed in a solution stained rapidly and continued to
swim about. Finally, a guinea-pig, under whose skin some powder
of Bismarck brown had been introduced, soon presented a yellow
staining of the buccal and anal mucous membranes and of the skin.
Seeds of cress sown on cotton soaked with a concentrated solution
of the Bismarck brown sprouted, and the young plants were strongly
stained brown; but on crushing the tissues and examining them
under the microscope, it was ascertained that the protoplasm of the
cells was very feebly coloured: the vessels, on the contrary, showed
a deep brown stain up to their termination of the leaf. The
mycelium of a mould developed in a solution of Bismarck brown
was clearly stained after having been washed in water, whilst it is
known that the mycelium, which frequently forms in coloured
solutions, picro-carmine, h&aelig;matoxylin, &amp;c., remained perfectly colourless.
Other aniline colours injected under the skin of frogs stained
the connective tissue as deeply as did the Bismarck brown; but the
stri&aelig; of muscle remained colourless. We may conclude, then, that
Bismarck brown possesses the quality of colouring living protoplasm
both in plants and in animals.</p>

<h3>Cutting, Grinding, and Mounting Hard Structures.</h3>

<p>Take the femur of cat, or rabbit, remove as much of the muscle as
possible and macerate it in water until quite clean; on removal hang
it up to dry. With a fine saw make transverse and longitudinal sections.
File the section down until flat, and smooth. Take some Canada
balsam, place a piece on a square of glass and warm gently over a
lamp until the balsam is plastic enough to allow of the section being
pressed into it, and set it aside to consolidate. Take a hone (“Water-of-Ayr”
stone), moisten it with water, and rub one side of the section upon
it until quite smooth, then place the glass slip, with the section still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
attached, into methylated spirit, and in a very short time the section
will be separated; wash it and remount it on the reverse side, and
proceed to rub it down on the hone until it appears to be thin enough
for mounting. Polish both sides on a polishing strop with Tripoli
powder, and mount in Canada balsam.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p class="hang">Fig. 244.&mdash;Small Lathe for
cutting and polishing
Sections of Teeth.</p></div>

<p><i>Teeth.</i>&mdash;The enamel of the teeth is a much harder structure than
that of bone, consequently it is found necessary to have recourse to
a cutting machine. Hand machines have been introduced for this
purpose, but the small lathe described in the earlier editions of my
book has in no way been superseded by later cutting machines.
<a href="#fig_244">Fig. 244</a> represents the small lathe used for
cutting and polishing every kind of hard
substance. With regard to the teeth, two
sections should be made perpendicular to
one another through the middle of the crown
and fang of the tooth from before backwards,
and from right to left, which will show the
peculiar structure of the enamel. The section
must be cemented to the carrier of the
stock of the lathe, or to the metal plate <i>a</i>,
and kept in position by the steel holder <i>b</i>;
the wheel being set in motion by the first
treadle. The embedding materials in use
are either gum-shellac or Canada balsam.
The former is more generally employed by
the lapidary and grinder of lenses than the
latter. As the enamel is liable to fracture
under the saw, it will be necessary to lessen the friction by
dripping water on the saw as it is made to revolve. Thick sections
can be quickly ground down against the corrondum wheel.
The final polishing of the section may be done on the lathe, or
by rubbing the flattened surface with water upon a “Water-of-Ayr”
stone, and ultimately set up in Canada balsam, which must
not be too fluid, or it will penetrate the <i>lacun&aelig;</i> and <i>canaliculi</i>,
fill up the interspaces, and cause them to become quite invisible.
As the flatness of the polishing surfaces is a matter of importance,
the stones themselves should be tested from time to time, and
when found to present an uneven surface must be rubbed down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
on a granite stone with fine sand, or on a lead plate with emery
powder. If it is decided to use Canada balsam as the embedding
material, this must be prepared in the following manner:&mdash;The section
of tooth or bone must be attached to a slip of well-annealed glass by
hardened Canada balsam, and its adhesion effectually secured by
placing the slide on the cover of a water bath, or in the hot-chamber
(<a href="#fig_256">Fig. 256</a>), when the balsam, a thick drop of which should be used,
will spread out by liquefaction. The slide should then be removed
and allowed to cool in order that the hardness of the balsam may be
tested. If too soft, as indicated by its readily yielding to the pressure
of the thumb-nail, the heating process must be repeated, care being
taken not to cause it to boil and form bubbles; if too hard, which
will be shown by its chipping, it must be remelted and diluted with
fluid balsam, and then set aside as before. When it is found to be
of the right consistence, the section must be laid upon its surface
with the polished side downwards; the slip of glass is next to be
gradually warmed until the balsam is softened, care being taken to
avoid the formation of bubbles, then press the section gently down
with a needle upon the liquefied balsam, the pressure being just
applied on one side rather than over the whole surface, so as to drive
the superfluous balsam towards the opposite side; finally, an equable
pressure over the whole will secure a perfect attachment of the
section without air bubbles. If, however, these should present
themselves in drying, and they cannot otherwise be expelled by
pressure, it will be found better to take the section off and relay
it as before. The thickness of the layer of balsam may be reduced
by rubbing it down before applying the glass-cover.</p>

<p><i>Rock Sections.</i>&mdash;Small pieces of rock may be ground down by the
aid of the lathe, or on a zinc plate, with emery powder and water,
until one side is rendered smooth and flat. Then fasten the polished
side of the section to a square of glass on the metal holder of the
lathe, with dried Canada balsam, as directed for bone, and allow it
time to become consolidated. When moderately thin take a piece of
plate-glass and some fine emery or putty-powder and rub the section
down as thin as possible. When found to be thin enough wash it
well in water, and put it aside to dry, or warm it over a spirit-lamp,
and with a needle push the section off the glass into a watch-glass of
benzole or turpentine, and allow it to soak until all the balsam is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
dissolved out. Wash again in turpentine, and mount in Canada
balsam, with or without a cover-glass. Sections of echinus spines,
shells, stones of fruits, &amp;c., are prepared in the same way as those of
bones and teeth; but when the grinding is finished, the sections
must be passed through alcohol into oil of cloves, after which they
should be mounted in Canada balsam. If tolerably thin, sections of
these substances can be cut in the lathe; in the first instance, there
will be no actual occasion to attach them to glass at all, except for
the purpose of obtaining a hold upon the specimen for polishing, but
the surface thus attached must afterwards be completely removed in
order to bring into view a stratum which the Canada balsam may
not have penetrated.</p>

<p>With regard to smaller bodies, these can scarcely be treated in any
other way than by attaching a number of them to slips of glass at once,
and in such a way as to make them mutually support each other. Thus
in making horizontal and vertical sections of <i>foraminifera</i>, it would
be impossible to slice them through unless they were laid close
together in a bed of hardened Canada balsam, and first grinding
away one side and then turning and rubbing down the other.
My friend, Dr. Wallich, many years ago communicated to me the
ingenious plan adopted by himself when mounting and turning a
number of these minute objects together. The specimens being
cemented with Canada balsam, in the first instance, to a thin film of
mica, and then attached to a glass slide by the same means, when
ground down to the thinness desired, the slide must be gradually
heated just sufficiently to allow of the detachment of the mica-film
and the specimen it carries; a clean slide with a thin layer of
hardened balsam having been prepared, the mica-film is transferred
to it with the ground surface downward. Its adhesion by drying
having been complete, the grinding and polishing should be proceeded
with; and as the mica-film will yield to the stone without any
difficulty, the specimen now reversed in position may be further
reduced to the requisite thickness for mounting as a permanent
object.</p>

<p><i>Staining and Mounting Vegetable Tissues.</i>&mdash;Bacteria I propose to
treat of in a separate section. Vegetable tissues generally will first
receive attention, and their differentiation is based on the employment
of delicate gradations of colour stains. The more striking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
results are obtained by <i>Multiple Staining</i>, while the cell contents are
rendered more palpable. On this account colouring media have been
divided into <i>nuclear</i>, <i>plasmic</i>, and <i>specific</i>. The first are chiefly valued
in proportion as they prove to have a selective affinity for the nuclei
of cells, and leaving the protoplasm comparatively unstained. Such
stains are needful for fresh and young tissues. On the other hand,
<i>plasmic</i> stains colour tissue uniformly, and are used to give a ground
colour by way of contrast; and <i>specific</i> stains are chiefly employed to
distinguish certain elementary structures from the mass of cellulose
which forms the basis of vegetable tissue, and which is also met
with to a slight extent in animal membranes.</p>

<p>Cellulose, as it occurs in plant life, presents a variety of physical
properties: sometimes it is soft, as in young plants, and again quite
dense in older structures. This fact accounts for the varying results
obtained when cellulose is subjected to the action of staining fluids,
and whether the cellulose occurs in a nearly pure form, as in cotton
fibre, or in the modified form of lignine or woody-fibre. Stains which
readily attack young tissue have little or no effect upon it in its
maturer form. It is of much importance, then, in the staining of
fibres, as well as sections for the microscope, that the cellulose
should take the stain uniformly.</p>

<p>The staining of tissues may be effected in four ways. First,
when the stain has sufficient affinity for the tissue to be retained by
it without the intervention of any outside agent. Second, when
the stain and mordant are mixed and applied to the tissue in one
solution. These two are the simplest and easiest methods of
staining. Third, when the tissue is first immersed in the staining
liquid and then transferred to some other liquid which shall fix the
colour upon the tissue. Fourth, when the tissue is first impregnated
with the mordant, or fixing agent, and then immersed in the stain.
The last method is the one usually followed in commercial works,
and it is to be recommended in the staining of microscopical
preparations which do not readily take the stain.</p>

<p><i>Nuclear Stains.</i>&mdash;As in both vegetable and animal sections it is
generally the nuclei which form the landmarks of the structure,
so the most important class of reagents which are used in any of
the branches of microscopical work are the “nuclear stains.” There
are several of these stains, the most important of which is the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
h&aelig;matoxylin, and when proper solutions are used the results are
very satisfactory. Many formul&aelig; have been given, but there are
three only reliable, Delafield’s, Kleinenberg’s, and Ehrlich’s, in all
of which alum is present as an ingredient; the idea being that the
alumina forms with the colouring matter an insoluble lake, and so
acts as a mordant.</p>

<p>In <i>Delafield’s</i> solutions a large proportion of alum to h&aelig;matoxylin
is used, and methylic alcohol (wood-spirit in the place of rectified
spirit).</p>

<p>For <i>Kleinenberg’s</i> solution many different formul&aelig; exist. Squire’s
improved formul&aelig; for both stains is given in the Appendix, “<i>Formul&aelig;
and Methods</i>.”</p>

<p>H&aelig;matoxylin solutions stain the nuclei violet, and in order to
change this into blue, the sections should be transferred to water
taken from the house supply, not distilled water; but as the
alkalinity of the water varies in different localities, a better and
more uniform result is obtained by using a weak solution of bicarbonate
of sodium (half a grain to the ounce).</p>

<p><i>Carmine</i> is also much in vogue as a nuclear stain, and the two
solutions more generally employed are Greenacher’s alcoholic borax
carmine, and Orth’s lithium carmine. Under ordinary circumstances
they act as general stains, affecting the ground tissue as well as the
nuclei. By subsequent treatment with acidulated alcohol or acidulated
glycerine the colour is discharged from the ground tissue
without seriously affecting the nuclei. Used in this way, carmine
becomes a good nuclear stain. It should be remembered that the
sections must not be washed in pure water, as the colour will to a
great extent be discharged; nor in acidulated water, as the carmine
will be precipitated.</p>

<p>Alum carmine and alum cochineal are useful nuclear stains, not
requiring after-treatment.</p>

<p><i>Picro-carmines</i> are also largely used. The following formul&aelig; will
be found the most useful:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ammonia Picro-carmine.</i>&mdash;Carmine, one gramme; strong solution
of ammonia, three cc.; distilled water, five cc. Dissolve the carmine
in the ammonia and water with a gentle heat, then add
saturated aqueous solution of picric acid, 200 cc.; heat to boiling,
and filter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span></p>

<p><i>Picro-Lithium Carmine.</i>&mdash;The following is generally preferred for
use&mdash;Lithium carmine solution, 100 cc.; saturated solution of
picric acid, 270 cc.</p>

<p>There are several aniline dyes which are used for nuclear staining:
methylene blue, methyl green, safranine, gentian violet, vesuvine,
fuchsine, and Hoffmann’s blue.</p>

<p>The usual process is to stain in &frac14; or &frac12; per cent. aqueous solutions
and wash in methylated spirit. Methylene blue and methyl green
have the reputation of being so readily washed out in the
methylated spirit as to be worthless. This is obviated by washing
the sections (when removed from the stain) in distilled water,
previous to the differentiation in methylated spirit. Treated in this
manner, the nuclear staining is very beautiful. This also applies to
Hoffmann’s blue and partly to vesuvine; with the latter, however, it
is not a necessity. Safranine and gentian violet worked better by
transferring the sections directly from the stain into 90 per cent.
alcohol.</p>

<p><i>Contrast Stains.</i>&mdash;Very frequently other stains are used to dye the
ground a colour which is in contrast to that employed for the nuclei.
Brown, orange, or pink are used after nuclear blue or green. Carmine
is generally counterstained yellow or indigo-blue; and fuchsine red,
as in tubercle bacilli, is counterstained with nuclear blue. It is
important that the ground stain should be made weaker than the
principal stain, so that the whole tissue may be shown without
detracting from the nuclei. The following colours are used as
counterstains for animal sections, but they prove less useful for
vegetable sections: benzo-purpurine, eosin, erythrosine, orange, acid
rubin, and picric acid.</p>

<p>Examples of <i>specific</i> stains are fuchsine, methylene blue, and
gentian violet for bacteria; osmic acid for fatty elements; victoria
blue and rose bengale, for demonstrating elastic tissue; methyl
violet, iodine, and safranine, for amyloid degeneration. Methylene blue
is one of the most useful of aniline dyes, and one of the most variable
in composition.</p>

<p><i>Iodine green</i>, or methyl green, has long been in use as a reagent
for amyloid, starchy matters, in ignorance of the fact that the reaction
is due to the methyl violet, contained as an impurity in the iodine
green. It is exceedingly difficult to obtain a green quite free from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
violet. As nuclear stains they are identical, and the amyloid
reaction, being dependent wholly upon the contained violet, varies,
not with the formula of the green, but with the extent to which it
has been purified.</p>

<p><i>Cellulose reactions.</i>&mdash;After the nuclear stains, the most important
reagents to the botanist are those which affect cellulose and its
several modifications. Pure cellulose is coloured yellow by iodine,
the colour being changed to a blue on the addition of slightly dilute
sulphuric acid, or a strong solution of zinc. Solutions containing
iodine, iodide of potassium, and chloride of zinc, give a violet reaction
with unaltered cellulose, and yellow with lignine.</p>

<p>Schulze’s zinc re-agent must be used with a certain amount of
caution, as the chloride of zinc and potassium undergo decomposition.
The formula now in use is as follows: Take of zinc
chloride solution (sp. gr. 1·85) 70 cc., potassium iodide 10 grammes,
iodine 0·1 gramme; but this solution can only be employed as a
re-agent and not as a dye, and structures stained with it cannot be
mounted in any of the ordinary media, and the only fluid for ringing
them down is caoutchouc cement.</p>

<p>Cellulose can be stained permanently by carmine, h&aelig;matoxylin,
nigrosine, methylene blue, safranine, and fuchsine. The aniline dyes
are used in dilute aqueous solutions containing one-eighth or one-fourth
per cent. of dye. When the cellulose undergoes the change
known as lignification its reactions are altered. It is coloured yellow
by chloro-zinc iodine, red by phloroglucin, yellow by aniline chloride.
The two latter are much assisted by hydrochloric acid. The results
of these reactions also cannot be preserved in the usual mounting
media.</p>

<p>Sections containing mixed tissue, partly unaltered cellulose and
partly lignified, give striking results with aniline dyes, and with this
additional advantage can be preserved for years.</p>

<p><i>Double Staining.</i>&mdash;When a section is passed through methyl green
solution and afterwards one of carmine, the lignified portion is
coloured green and the unlignified red. Acid green may be used
in the place of methyl green, with a similar result. When picric
acid is used with carmine, ingrosine, or Hoffmann’s blue, the picric
acid dyes the ligneous portion and the others colour the unlignified
structure, red, black, and blue respectively.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span></p>

<p><i>Eosin stain</i> is the most useful for sieve-tubes and plates. Make
a strong solution of eosin in equal parts of water and alcohol, and
stain the section for five or ten minutes. Wash well in methylated
spirit, dehydrate, clean in oil of cloves, and mount in Canada balsam.</p>

<p><i>Bleaching Process.</i>&mdash;The bleaching and clearing of vegetable
structures before staining is a very necessary process, especially so
if starch be present in any quantity. Clearing agents are of two
kinds&mdash;those which act by virtue of their property of strongly
refracting light, and those which disintegrate and dissolve the
amyloid cell contents. To the first class belong the essential oils,
as oil of cloves, Canada balsam, glycerine, and other similar bodies;
to the second class, solutions of potash, phenol, and chloral hydrate.
The actual value of some of these agents is questionable. The
process usually preferred is as follows: Place the sections in a fresh
clear solution of chlorinated lime, allowing them to remain until
quite bleached, say from two to four or five minutes; then gently
warm in a test-tube for a few seconds, and quickly replace the
solution with distilled water and boil for two or three minutes;
repeat the treatment with boiling water three times; wash with a
one per cent. solution of acetic acid, and finally with distilled water.
The sections are then quite ready for staining operations.</p>

<p>When the stem is hard and brown, a solution of chloride of lime
should be used&mdash;a quarter of an ounce of chloride dissolved in a
pint of water, well shaken and stood by to settle down, then pour
off the clear fluid for use. For hard tissues this solution answers
well, but it is not suitable for leaves, as they require not only
bleaching, but the cell contents should be dissolved out to render
them transparent. A solution of chlorinated soda answers well for
both stems and leaves. It is prepared as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>To one pint of water add two ounces of fresh chloride of lime,
shake or stir it well two or three times, then allow it to stand till
the lime has settled. Prepare meanwhile a saturated solution of
carbonate of soda&mdash;common washing soda. Now pour off the clear
supernatant fluid from the chloride of lime, and add to it, by
degrees, the soda solution, when a precipitate of carbonate of lime
will be thrown down; continue to add the soda solution till no
further precipitate is formed. Filter the solution, and keep it in a
well-stoppered bottle in the dark, otherwise it speedily spoils.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p>Sections bleached in chlorinated soda must, when white enough,
be washed in distilled water, and allowed to remain in it for twenty-four
hours, changing the water four or five times, and adding a few
drops of nitric acid, or at the rate of eight or ten drops to the
half-pint, to the water employed before the final washing takes place.
From water transfer them to alcohol, in which they must remain for
an hour or more.</p>

<p>Although alkaline glycerine has been recommended for several
purposes in micro-technique, it is not so well known as it should be
how serviceable it is as an extempore mounting solution in vegetable
histology. The best mixture for general use is composed of
glycerine 2 ozs., distilled water 1&frac12; oz., solution of potash, B.P.,
&frac12; oz. This combines the refringent property of the glycerine with
the clearing action of the caustic potash, while the swelling action
of the potash is considerably diminished.</p>

<p><i>Cutting Sections of Hard Woods.</i>&mdash;The lathe and circular saw
will be found as useful for cutting sections of the harder kinds of
woods, as for bone structure. It may be necessary to subject the
older and consequently harder pieces of wood to the action of steam
for a few hours to soften them, and afterwards transfer them to
methylated spirit, before making an attempt to cut sections. But
the more open woods, of one, two, or three years’ growth, will show
all that may be required, and these can be cut by hand, or with
the microtome, as already described.</p>

<p>With a little practice the finest and thinnest possible slices may
be cut by hand. It is usual to take off the first slice to give a
smooth and even surface to the specimen. Then turn the screw to
raise it a little, sprinkle the surface with spirit and water, and cut
with a light hand. Remove the cut sections with a fine camel’s-hair
brush or a section lifter (<a href="#fig_250">Fig. 250</a>) to a small vessel containing
water, when the thinnest will float on the surface, and remove to
methylated spirit and water, where they should remain until they
can be mounted. Sections of hard woods, and those containing
gum-resins, or other insoluble material, must first be kept in
methylated spirit or alcohol, and finally transferred to oil of cloves,
to render them sufficiently transparent for mounting in Canada
balsam.</p>

<p>If the structure of an exogenous wood is required to be examined,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
the sections should be made in at least three different ways: the
transverse, the longitudinal, and the oblique, or, as they are sometimes
called, the horizontal, vertical, and tangential, each of which
will exhibit different appearances, as seen in <a href="#fig_245">Fig. 245</a>: <i>b</i> is a
vertical section through the pith of a coniferous plant, and exhibits
the medullary rays known to the cabinet-maker as the silver grain;
<i>e</i> is a magnified view of a part of the same; the woody fibres are
seen with their dots <i>l</i>, and the horizontal lines <i>k</i> indicating the
medullary rays cut lengthwise; <i>c</i> is a tangential section, and <i>f</i> a
portion of the same; the medullary rays <i>m m</i>, and the woody fibres
with vertical slices of the dots, are shown. Instructive preparations
will be secured by cutting oblique sections of the stem. The sections
seen are made from the pine. All exogenous stems, however, exhibit
three different appearances, according to the direction in which the
section is made.</p>

<h3>Bacteria Cultivation, Sterilising, and Preparing for
Microscopical Examination.</h3>

<p>That branch of mycology which is now looked upon as a separate
department of science, termed bacteriology, took shape in the years
1875-9, when its founder, the veteran botanist Cohn, who recognised
that the protoplasm of plants corresponded to the animal sarcode,
published his exact mode of studying bacteria. But it was a pupil
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
of his, Dr. Koch, who a year later discovered that a specific cattle
disease, anthrax, was due to a bacillus, and it was he also who gave us
the useful modification of gelatine as a medium in which to grow
bacteria; he hit upon the method of pouring melted gelatine containing
distributed germs on to plates, and thus isolating the colonies
and ensuring the further isolation of the spores, and so facilitate the
preparation of pure cultures on a large scale, and with great saving
of time.</p>

<p>The difficulty of isolating a bacterium and tracing its life history
under the microscope must at first sight appear great. A further
objection that such work is slow and difficult has no more weight here
than in any other department of science, as will be seen on proceeding
to follow out the directions I am about to furnish for the use of the
student.</p>

<p>As the alcohol evaporates from the warmed surface of the glass
slide a hard transparent coating is left. This may be slightly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
softened at any time by means of a drop of oil of lavender. After
arranging the objects the heat of a spirit-lamp will cause the oil to
evaporate, leaving them firmly attached. Objects may be mounted
on cover-glasses in a similar way. A resinous mounting medium may
then be employed in the usual manner. If glycerine or glycerine jelly
is the mounting medium employed, collodion diluted with two or
three times its volume of oil of lavender may be found preferable as
the fixing agent. The section should be placed in position before
the preparation dries and the oil is evaporated.</p>

<p>Methylated spirit is often so largely adulterated with rock-oil
as to render it unsuitable for technical purposes. Even to varnishes
it imparts a fluorescent appearance as it dries off.</p>

of wire into a glass rod about six inches long. The glass rod must
be heated at the extreme end in the flame of a Bunsen burner, or
blow-pipe, and the platinum wire held near one extremity with
forceps, and fused into the end of the glass rod. Some of these rods
should be straight, and some bent, and others provided with a loop,

<p><i>Lister’s Flasks.</i>&mdash;Lister devised a globe-shaped flask with two

tapering towards the extremity. When the vessel is restored to the
erect position after pouring out some of its
contents, a drop of liquid remains behind in
the end of the nozzle, and thus prevents the
regurgitation of air through the spout. A
cap of cotton-wool is tied over the orifice, and
the residue left in the flask for future use.
The vertical neck of the flask is plugged with
sterilised cotton-wool in the ordinary way.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 256.&mdash;Pfeiffer’s Warm Chamber.</p></div>

<p><i>The Warm Chamber.</i>&mdash;This is an accessory of importance in
bacteriological work. For the continuous heating of specimens
during cultivation it is an absolute necessity. Pfeiffer’s warm
chamber (<a href="#fig_256">Fig. 256</a>) is suitable for microscopical work generally. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
consists of a hard-wood box, made air-tight, with doors and glass
windows to allow of the specimen being moved from time to time,
and kept under constant observation. The box is mounted on a
metal plate tripod stand, and is heated from below by a small gas
burner, with a thermo-regulator. A paraffin lamp will do as well,
so long as it maintains a temperature of from 25&deg; to 45&deg;C., and
without danger of injury to the stand and lenses of the microscope.
A thermometer is placed in the air space to mark the temperature.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_257" src="images/fig_257.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 257.&mdash;Crookshank’s Incubator.</p></div>

<p><i>Hot-air Incubators and Sterilisers</i> are usually made of sheet-iron,
in the form of a cubical chest, with double walls, supported on four
legs, as that of Dr. Crookshank’s (<a href="#fig_257">Fig. 257</a>). They are heated by
gas or a lamp from below, while the temperature is indicated by
a thermometer inserted through a hole in the top, as in that of the
Hearson’s incubator. Test-tubes, flasks, funnels, cotton-wool, &amp;c.,
must be sterilised by exposure to a temperature of 150&deg;C. for an
hour or more.</p>

<p><i>Wire Cages</i> or crates are used for containing test-tubes, especially
when they are to be sterilised in the hot-air steriliser, or for lowering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
tubes of nutrient jelly into the steam steriliser. All instruments,
needles, scalpels, &amp;c., before using must be carefully sterilised.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_258" src="images/fig_258.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 258.&mdash;Dr. Koch’s
Steam Steriliser.</p></div>

<p><i>Steam Sterilisers</i> are made either of iron or tin, jacketed with
thick felt, and provided with a conical cap or lid perforated at
the apex to receive a thermometer (<a href="#fig_258">Fig. 258</a>). Inside the vessel
is an iron grating or diaphragm about two-thirds of the way down,
which divides the interior into two chambers, the upper or steam
chamber, and the lower or water chamber. A gauge outside marks
the level of the water in the lower chamber;
this should be kept about two-thirds
full. The apparatus stands upon three
legs, and is heated from below with a
Bunsen burner or a lamp. It is employed
for sterilising nutrient media in tubes or
flasks, for cooking potatoes or hastening
the filtration of agar-agar. When the
thermometer indicates 100&deg; C. the lid is
removed, and test-tubes are lowered in a
wire-basket by means of a hook and
string, and the lid quickly replaced.
Potatoes or small flasks are lowered into
the cylinder in a tin receiver with a perforated
bottom, which rests upon the
grating, and admits of the contents being
exposed to the steam generated.</p>

<p>One of the most efficient forms of incubators
introduced into the bacteriological
laboratory is that known as Hearson’s
(<a href="#fig_259">Fig. 259</a>). This consists of a chamber surrounded by a water-jacket,
with water space below, to afford room for the pipe, L, which
conveys the heated products from the flame of the lamp, T, through
the water and back again to the lantern. A is the water-jacket
surrounding the chamber containing the cultures; O, the pipe
through which the water supply is admitted; N, the tap for
employing the same; M, the overflow pipe; S, the capsule in
a case attached by a tube to the lower plate outside; D, a lever
pivoted on the left, carrying at its free end a damper, F, which,
when resting on the chimney, V, effectually closes it; P, a screw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
for adjusting the damper when starting the apparatus; H, a lead
weight for bringing more pressure on the capsule; K, a thermometer,
the bulb of which is inside and the scale outside the chamber.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_259" src="images/fig_259.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 259.&mdash;The Baird-Hearson Biological Incubator.</p></div>

<p>The treated products of combustion move in the direction indicated
until the water and chamber are sufficiently heated to distend the
capsule. When this point is reached the wire between S and P is
pushed up by the capsule, and the lever causes the damper to rise
more or less off the chimney, V, and on examining the thermometer
the inside of the chamber is at length found to remain steadily at
the required temperature.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span></p>

<p>When the thermometer registers the desired temperature, the
lead weight must be damped to the lever by means of the milled-head
screw which goes through it. After having been once adjusted
the heat in the interior will remain constant, notwithstanding the
utmost changes of temperature occurring in these latitudes, nor will
very great alterations in the size of the lamp-flame seriously interfere
with the results. The milled-head screw, P, must be turned, after
the first adjustment, during the whole time that the incubator is in
use. Observe the temperature before opening the door; observations
taken afterwards are worthless.</p>

<h3>Preparation of Nutrient Media&mdash;Separation, and
Cultivation of Bacteria.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_260" src="images/fig_260.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 260.&mdash;Plate Cultivation Showing Colonies.</p></div>

<p>To cultivate micro-organisms artificially they must be supplied
with the proper nutrient material, perfectly free from pre-existing
organisms. The secret of Koch’s methods greatly depends upon
the possibility, in the case of starting with a mixture of micro-organisms,
of being able to isolate them completely one from
another, and to obtain an absolutely pure growth of each cultivable
species. When sterile nutrient gelatine has been liquefied in a test-tube
and inoculated with a mixture of bacteria in such a way that
the individual micro-organisms are distributed throughout it, and
the liquid is poured out on a glass plate and allowed to solidify, the
individual bacteria, instead of moving about freely as in a liquid
medium, are fixed to one spot, where they develop their own species.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
In this way colonies are formed, each possessing its own biological
characteristics and morphological appearances (<a href="#fig_260">Fig. 260</a>).</p>

<p>To maintain individuals isolated from each other during growth,
and free from contamination, it is only necessary to thin out the
cultivation to protect the plates from the air, and to have facilities
for examining them from time to time, and observing the characteristic
microscopical appearances. The colonies on nutrient gelatine
examined with a low power (<a href="#fig_260">Fig. 260</a>), if micro-organisms such as
<i>Bacillus anthraces</i> and <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>, the naked eye appearances
in test-tubes of the growth of the bacilli of anthrax and tubercle,
and the brilliant growth of micro-coccus prodigiosus, may be given
as examples in which the appearances are often very striking and
sometimes quite characteristic. I must, however, first direct
attention to a well-recognised fact, that bacteriology only touches
animal pathology at a few points, and that so far from bacteria
being synonymous with <i>disease germs</i>, the majority of these
remarkable organisms appear to be beneficent rather than inimical to
man. This is of immense importance to science, as I shall attempt
to show further on; although even a brief description of all the
useful ferments due to bacteria and brought into use would occupy
a volume to themselves, and call for a school of bacteriology quite
apart from that involved in the medical aspect of the question, for
the purpose of fully investigating problems raised by the agriculturist,
the forester, the gardener, the dairyman, brewer, dyer, tanner,
and other industries, which open up vistas of practical application,
and to some extent are already being taken advantage of in
commerce.</p>

<p><i>The Preparation of Nutrient Gelatine and Agar-agar.</i>&mdash;Take half
a kilogramme (one pound) of beef as free as possible from fat, chop
finely, transfer to a flask or cylindrical vessel, and shake up well
with a litre of distilled water. Place the vessel in an ice-pail, or
ice-cupboard, or in winter in a cold cellar, and leave for the night.
Next morning commence with the preparation of all requisite
apparatus. Thoroughly wash and rinse with alcohol about 100
test-tubes, and allow them to dry. Plug the mouths of the test-tubes
with cotton-wool, place them in their wire cages in the hot-air
steriliser, to be heated for an hour at a temperature of 150&deg;C.
In the same manner cleanse and sterilise several flasks, and a small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
glass funnel. In the meantime, the meat infusion must be well
shaken, and the liquid portion separated by filtering and squeezing
through a linen cloth or a meat press. The red juice thus obtained
must be brought up to a litre by transferring it to a large measuring
glass and adding distilled water. It is then poured into a sufficiently
large and strong beaker, and set aside after the addition of ten
grammes of peptone, five grammes of common salt, and 100 grammes
of best gelatine.</p>

<p>In about half an hour the gelatine is sufficiently softened, and subsequent
heating in a water bath causes it to be completely dissolved.</p>

<p>The next process requires the greatest care and attention. Some
micro-organisms grow best in a slightly acid, others in a slightly
alkaline, medium. For example, for the growth and characteristic
appearances of the <i>comma bacillus</i> of Asiatic cholera a faintly
alkaline soil is absolutely essential. This slightly alkaline medium
will be found to answer best for most micro-organisms, and may be
obtained as follows:&mdash;With a clean glass rod dipped in the mixture,
the reaction upon litmus-paper may be obtained, and a concentrated
solution of carbonate of soda must be added drop by drop until red
litmus-paper becomes faintly blue. If it is too alkaline, it can be
neutralised by the addition of lactic acid.</p>

<p>Finally, the mixture is heated for an hour in the water-bath. Ten
minutes before the boiling is completed the white of an egg beaten
up with the shell is added, and the liquid is then filtered while hot.</p>

<p>During filtration the funnel should be covered over with a plate
of glass, and the process of filtering must be repeated, if necessary,
until a pale straw-coloured, perfectly transparent filtrate results.
The sterilised test-tubes are filled to about a third of their depth by
pouring in the gelatine carefully and steadily. The object of this
care is to prevent the mixture touching the part of the tube with
which the plug comes into contact; otherwise, when the gelatine
sets, the cotton-wool adheres to the tubes and becomes a source of
embarrassment to subsequent procedures. As the tubes are filled
they are placed in a basket, and then sterilised. They are either
lowered into the steam steriliser, when the thermometer indicates
100 cc., for twelve minutes, for four or five successive days, or they
may be transferred to the test-tube water-bath, and heated for an
hour or two for three successive days.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

<p>If the gelatine shows any turbidity after, it must be poured back into
a flask, boiled for ten minutes, and filtered again, and the process of
sterilisation repeated.</p>

<p><i>Nutrient Agar-agar</i> is a substance prepared from seaweed which
grows on the coasts of Japan and India, and is supplied in long
crinkled strips. It boils at 90&deg; C., and remains solid up to a
temperature of about 45&deg; C. It is therefore substituted for gelatine
in the preparation of a jelly for the cultivation of those bacteria
which will grow best in the incubator at the temperature of the
blood, and also at ordinary temperature for bacteria which lignify
gelatine. The preparation is conducted on much the same principles
as those already described. Instead, however, of 100 grammes of
gelatine, only about twenty grammes of agar-agar (1·5 to 2 per
cent.), and to facilitate the solution it must be allowed to soak in
salt water overnight. Flannel is substituted for filter paper. The
hot-water apparatus is invariably employed. The final results, when
solid, should be colourless and clear; but if slightly milky, it may
still be employed.</p>

<p><i>Wort-gelatine</i> is used in studying the bacteria of fermentation. It
is made by adding from five to ten per cent. of gelatine to beer-wort.</p>

<p><i>Glycerine Agar-agar.</i>&mdash;This is made by adding five per cent. of
glycerine to nutrient agar-agar, after the boiling and before the
filtration.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_261" src="images/fig_261.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 261.&mdash;Pure Cultivation in Tubes (Crookshank).</p></div>

<p><i>Test-tube Cultivations.</i>&mdash;To inoculate test-tubes containing nutrient
jelly, the cotton-wool plug is removed. A sterilised needle, charged,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
for example, with blood or pus containing bacteria, is thrust once in
the middle line into the nutrient jelly, and steadily withdrawn.
The tube should be held horizontally or with its mouth downwards,
and the plug replaced as quickly as possible, and an india-rubber
cap fitted over the mouth of the tube.</p>

<p>The appearance produced by the growths in the test-tubes can
be in most cases sufficiently examined with the naked eye (<a href="#fig_261">Fig. 261</a>).
In some cases the jelly is partially liquefied, while in others it remains
solid. The growths may be abundant or scanty, coloured or colourless.
When liquefaction slowly takes place in the needle tracts, the
appearances which result are often very delicate and in some very
characteristic. The appearance of a simple white thread with branching
lateral filaments, of a cloudiness, or of a string of beads in the track
of the needle, may be given as examples. In some cases much may be
learnt by means of a magnifying-glass.</p>

<p>Beneke recommends that gelatine culture tubes should be
inoculated by making a puncture quite at the side of the medium,
close to the glass. The advantage of this method over the plan of
inoculating the mass in the middle is that the growing culture can
be microscopically examined from the outside, and various details
made out, such as the nature of the growth, the comparative
appearance of colonies near the surface and those situated more
deeply, and the presence of one or more distinct organisms. If the
tubes used have the opposite sides flat and parallel, such examinations
will be still further facilitated.</p>

<p><i>Plate Cultivations.</i>&mdash;By this method a mixture of bacteria, whether
in fluids, excreta, or in cultivations on solid media, can be so treated
that the different species are isolated one from the other, and perfectly
pure cultivations of each of the cultivable bacteria in the original
mixture established in various nutrient media. We are enabled also
to examine under a low power of the microscope the individual
colonies of bacteria. The same process, with slight modification,
is also employed in the examination of air, soil, and water.</p>

<p>In order to spread out the liquid jelly evenly on the surface of a
glass plate, and to hasten its solidification, it is necessary to place the
plate upon a level and cool surface. The glass plates are sterilised
in an iron box placed in the hot-air steriliser, at 150&deg; C., from one to
two hours.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span></p>

<p>The damp chambers for the reception of the inoculated plates
are prepared by cleansing and washing out with one in twenty
carbolic acid the shallow glass dish and bell-cover (<a href="#fig_253">Fig. 253</a>). A
piece of filter-paper should cover the bottom of dish, moistened with
the same solution.</p>

<p>“In a glass-beaker with pad of cotton-wool at bottom place tube
containing cultivation, the three tubes to be inoculated, three glass rods
which have to be sterilised, and a thermometer. Liquefy the gelatine
in the three tubes by placing them in a beaker containing water 30&deg; C.
Keep the tubes, both before and after the inoculation, in the warm
water to maintain the gelatine in a state of liquefaction. Remove the
plug from the culture and also the plug of test-tube with liquefied jelly.
With the needle take up a droplet of the cultivation and stir it round
in the liquefied jelly. Replace both plugs, and set aside the cultivation.
Hold the freshly-inoculated tube almost horizontally, then
raise it to the vertical, so that the liquid gelatine gently flows back.
By repeating this motion, and rolling the tube, the micro-organisms
which have been introduced are distributed throughout the gelatine.
Any violent shaking, and consequent formation of bubbles, must be
carefully avoided. Inoculate the second tube, and also third, in the
same way, but with three droplets from a sterilised needle. The
next process consists in pouring out the gelatine on glass plates and
allowing it to solidify.</p>

<p>“Remove cover of box containing sterilised plates, withdraw a plate
with sterilised forceps, and rapidly transfer it to the filter-paper
under the bell-glass and quickly replace cover of box. Remove plug
from the test-tube which was first inoculated, and the contents are
poured out on the plate. With a glass rod the gelatine must be then
rapidly spread out in an even layer within about half an inch of
the margin of the plate, the bell-glass is replaced, and the gelatine
is allowed to set. Meanwhile a glass bench is placed in damp
chamber, upon which the plate is placed when the gelatine is quite
solid; precisely the same process is repeated with the other tubes.</p>

<p>“The colonies will be found to develop in the course of a day or
two, the time varying with the temperature of the room. The lower
plate will contain a countless number of colonies, which, if the micro-organisms
liquefy gelatine, speedily commingle, and produce in a very
short time a complete liquefaction of the whole gelatine. On the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
middle plate the colonies will also be very numerous, but retain
their isolated positions for a longer time; while on the uppermost
plate the colonies are completely isolated from one another, with an
appreciable surface of gelatine intervening.</p>

<p>“The microscopical appearances of the colonies are best studied by
placing the plate on a slab of blackened glass, or on a porcelain slab
if the colonies are coloured. A small diaphragm is used, and the
appearances studied principally with a low power. A much simpler
method of plate-cultivation is to pour the liquefied jelly into shallow
flat dishes; they take up much less room, and in many ways are more
convenient.</p>

<p>“Nutrient agar-agar can also be employed for the preparation of
plate-cultivations, but it is much more difficult to obtain satisfactory
results.”</p>

<h3>Microscopical Examination of Bacteria.</h3>

<p><i>Bacteria in Liquids, Cultures, and Fresh Tissues.</i>&mdash;In conducting
bacteriological researches, the importance of absolute cleanliness
cannot be too strongly insisted upon. All instruments, glass vessels,
slides, and cover-glasses should be thoroughly cleansed before use.
The same applies to the preparation and employment of culture
media; any laxity in the processes of sterilisation, or insufficient
attention to minute technical details, will be followed with disappointing
results by contamination of the cultures, resulting in the loss of
much time.</p>

<p>For the preparation of microscopical specimens it will be found
convenient to use a platinum inoculating needle, sterilised, as before
directed, in the sheet-iron box; in a few moments it will be cool
enough not to destroy the bacteria with which it is brought into
contact.</p>

<p><i>Unstained Bacteria.</i>&mdash;The bacteria in liquids, such as blood and
culture-fluids, can be investigated in the unstained condition by
transferring a drop with a looped platinum needle, or a capillary
pipette, to a slide, covering it with a clean cover-glass, and examining
without further treatment. If it is desirable to keep the specimen
under prolonged observation, a drop of sterilised water or salt
solution must be run in at the margin of the cover-glass to counteract
the tendency to dry.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span></p>

<p>Cultures on the solid media can be examined by transferring a
small portion with a sterilised needle to a drop of sterilised water on
a slide, thinning it out, and covering with cover-glass as already
described. Tissues in the fresh state may be teased out with needles
(<a href="#fig_249">Fig. 249</a>) in sterilised salt solution, and pressed out into a sufficiently
thin layer between the slide and cover-glass. Glycerine may
in many cases be substituted for salt solution, especially for such as
actinomyces and mould fungi.</p>

<p>Very small bacilli and micro-cocci are distinguished from granular
matter or fat-crystals, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, by the fact that the latter are
altered or dispersed by the addition of acetic acid, and changed by
solution of potash; ether dissolves out fatty particles, while micro-organisms
remain unaffected. Baumgarten demonstrated tubercle
bacilli in sections by treating them with potash, which clarified the
tissues and brought the bacilli clearly into view. In examining
unstained bacteria the iris-diaphragm should be used, and the
sub-stage condenser carefully centred and focussed.</p>

<p>His’s Method of Staining.&mdash;A slide is prepared as for bacteria in
the fresh state; the reagents are then applied by placing them with a
pipette drop by drop at a margin of the cover-glass, and causing
them to flow through the preparation by means of a strip of filter-paper
placed at the opposite margin.</p>

<p>Bab&egrave;s’ Method is as follows: A little of the growth spread out on
a cover-glass into as thin a film as possible; when almost dry, apply
a drop or two of a weak aqueous solution of methyl-violet from a
pipette to the film; any excess of the stain must be removed by
gentle pressure with a strip of filter-paper.</p>

<p><i>Cover-glass Preparations.</i>&mdash;A cover-glass is smeared with the
substance to be examined spread out into a sufficiently thin layer;
in the case of cultures on solid media, diffuse the bacteria in a little
sterilised water. By means of another cover-glass the juice or fluid
is squeezed out from between them into a thin layer, and on sliding
them apart each cover-glass bears on it a thin film of the material.
The cover-glass is then placed with its film side upwards and allowed
to dry. After a few minutes it is passed from above downwards
through the flame of a Bunsen burner three times. Apply two or
three drops of an aqueous solution of fuchsine or methyl-violet to
cover the film, wash away any surplus stain after a few minutes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
with distilled water. The cover-glass is then allowed to dry, when
the preparation may be mounted in Canada balsam, or while still
wet, turned over on a slide, and the excess of water removed with
filter-paper.</p>

<p>If necessary to apply stain for a much larger period, pour staining
solution into a watch glass and allow cover-glass to swim on surface
with prepared side downwards.</p>

<p>Crookshank, instead of watery solutions of aniline dyes, prefers to
use stronger solutions, and to reduce the staining by a momentary
immersion in alcohol. The method is as follows: cover-glass preparations
are stained with carbolised fuchsine (<i>Neelsen’s solution</i>) for about
two minutes, rinsed in alcohol for a few seconds, and quickly washed in
water. This method is specially valuable for sarcin&aelig; and streptococci.</p>

<p><i>Gram’s Method.</i>&mdash;The whole film is first stained violet with gentian-violet,
fixed by a solution of iodine, in iodide of potassium in the
bacilli, but not in any d&eacute;bris, pus cells, or tissue elements present.
Transfer cover-glass to alcohol, the bacilli alone remain stained, the
violet colour being changed to blue. By employing a contrast colour,
such as eosin, a double staining is obtained.</p>

<p>For staining preparations with gentian-violet Crookshank employs
the following useful method:&mdash;Place four or five drops of pure
aniline in a test-tube, add distilled water to three-quarters full,
close mouth with thumb, shake thoroughly. Filter the emulsion
twice, pour filtrate into watch-glass. To the perfectly clear aniline
water thus obtained, add, drop by drop, a concentrated alcoholic
solution of gentian-violet till precipitation commences. Cover-glasses
must be left in this solution ten minutes, transferred to iodine-potassic-iodide
until the film becomes uniformly brown, then rinsed
in alcohol. The decolourisation may be hastened by dipping the
cover-glass in clove oil and returning to alcohol. Again immerse
cover-glass in clove oil, dry by gently pressing between two layers
of filter-paper, and mount in Canada balsam.</p>

<p><i>Double-staining</i> of cover-glass preparations.&mdash;They can be treated
by Ehrlich’s method for staining tubercular sputum, or by Neelsen’s
modification, or by staining with eosin after treatment by the method
of Gram.</p>

<p>Ehrlich’s Method is as follows: Five parts of aniline oil are shaken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
up with one hundred parts of distilled water, and the emulsion
filtered through moistened filter-paper. A saturated alcoholic solution
of fuchsine, methyl-violet, or gentian-violet, is added to filtrate
in watch-glass, drop by drop, until precipitation commences. Cover-glass
preparations are floated in this mixture for fifteen minutes to
half an hour, then washed for a few seconds in dilute nitric acid (one
part of nitric acid to two of water), then rinsed in distilled water.</p>

<p>Neelsen’s Solution and Methylene Blue.&mdash;Ziehl suggested the use
of carbolic acid as a substitute for aniline blue. Neelsen recommended
a solution of carbolic acid, absolute alcohol and fuchsine.
(See Appendix.)</p>

<p><i>Gram’s Solution and Eosin.</i>&mdash;After using Gram’s method as above
and decolourising in alcohol, the cover-glass is placed in a weak solution
of eosin for two or three minutes, washed in alcohol, immersed
in clove oil, dried, and mounted in balsam.</p>

<p><i>Staining of Spores.</i>&mdash;The cover-glass preparation must be heated to
210&deg; C. for half an hour, or passed about twelve times through the
flame of a Bunsen burner, or exposed to the action of strong sulphuric
acid for several seconds, then a few drops of a watery solution of
aniline dye applied in the usual way. To double-stain spore-bearing
bacilli the cover-glass preparation must be floated from twenty
minutes to an hour on Ehrlich’s fuchsine-aniline-water, or on the
Ziehl-Neelsen solution. The stain must be heated until steam arises.</p>

<h3>Staining of Flagella.</h3>

<p>Koch first stained flagella by floating the cover-glass on a watery
solution of h&aelig;matoxylin, transferring them to a five per cent. solution
of chromic acid, or to M&uuml;ller’s fluid, by which they obtained a
brownish-black coloration.</p>

<p><i>L&ouml;ffler’s Method.</i>&mdash;Add together aqueous solutions of ferrous-sulphate
and tannin (twenty per cent.) until the mixture turns a
violet-black colour, then add three or four cc. of a one-in-eight aqueous
solution of logwood; a few drops of carbolic acid may be added before
transferring to a stoppered bottle; that is the mordant. The dye
consists of 1 cc. of a one per cent. solution of caustic soda, added
to 100 cc. of aniline water, in which four or five grammes of
either methyl-violet, methylene blue, or fuchsine, are dissolved. A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
cover-glass preparation is made in the usual way, then the film is covered
with mordant, and cover-glass held over flame until steam rises, the
mordant is then washed off with distilled water. The stain is filtered
and a few drops allowed to fall on film, after a few minutes the cover-glass
is again warmed until steam rises. The stain is then washed
off with distilled water, and the preparation is ready to be mounted
for examination.</p>

<p>As L&ouml;ffler’s process is somewhat complicated, a modification has
been said to afford more satisfactory results. A specimen is taken
from a recent gelatine culture and diluted with water. A little of the
fluid is then transferred to a warm cover-glass by means of a pipette
and allowed to dry, after which a drop of the following mordant is
applied:&mdash;Aqueous solution of tannin (twenty per cent.), ten cc.;
cold saturated solution of ferrous sulphate, five cc.; saturated solution
of fuchsine in absolute alcohol, one cc. The cover is next
heated gently for a short time until vapours are given off, then
washed carefully. This process is repeated two or three times, and
the specimen washed after each application. Subsequently, staining
is effected by means of Ziehl’s fuchsine solution, the cover is afterwards
warmed once or twice for about fifteen seconds, then washed,
and the specimen examined in water to ascertain if the colour is
sufficiently intense. If satisfactory, the preparation may then be
dried and finally mounted in Canada balsam or dammar.</p>

<p><i>Preservation of Preparations.</i>&mdash;After examining a cover-glass
preparation with an oil-immersion objective the cedar oil must be
carefully wiped off, and the slide set aside for the Canada balsam to
set. At a convenient time these preparations should be sealed with
a ring of Hollis’s glue.</p>

<h3>Bacteria in Sections of Tissues.</h3>

<p><i>Method of Hardening and Decalcifying Tissues.</i>&mdash;To harden
small organs, such as the viscera of a mouse, they should be placed
on a piece of filter-paper at the bottom of a small wide-mouthed
glass jar, and covered with about twenty times their volume of
absolute alcohol. Larger organs are treated in the same way, but
must be cut up into small pieces. M&uuml;ller’s fluid, methylated spirit,
or formalin may be used.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span></p>

<p>Teeth, or osseous structures, must first be placed in a decalcifying
solution, as Kleinenberg’s. When sufficiently softened, soak in water,
to wash out picric acid, and transfer to weak spirit. Ebner’s solution
gives good results.</p>

<p>Methods of embedding, fixing, and cutting.&mdash;Crookshank finds
that after hardening, the pieces of tissue are embedded in a mixture
of ether and alcohol for an hour or more, then transferred to a
solution of celloidin in equal parts of ether and alcohol, and left
there for several hours.</p>

<p>The piece of tissue is then placed in a glass capsule, and some of
the celloidin solution poured over it. The capsule can be placed
bodily in 60 to 80 per cent. alcohol, and left there until the following
morning. The celloidin should be of the consistency of wax. The
piece of tissue is next cut out, and after trimming is put into water
until it sinks, then transferred to gum, and cut with the freezing
microtome.</p>

<p>Sections of fresh tissues are to be floated in ·8 per cent. salt
solution, and then carefully transferred by a platinum lifter to a
watch-glass containing absolute alcohol.</p>

<p><i>Staining Bacteria in Tissue Sections.</i>&mdash;Weigert’s method is as
follows:&mdash;Place sections for from six to eighteen hours in a one per
cent. watery solution of any of the basic aniline dyes. To hasten,
place the capsule containing solution in the incubator, or heat it to
45&deg; C., or a stronger solution may be used. In the latter case the
sections must be treated with a half-saturated solution of carbonate
of potash, as they are easily over-stained. In either case the
sections are next washed with distilled water, passed through sixty
per cent. alcohol into absolute alcohol. When almost decolourised,
spread out on a platinum lifter and transfer to clove oil, or stain
with picro-carmine solution (Weigert’s) for half an hour, wash in
water, alcohol, and treat with clove oil, and transfer to clean glass
slide.</p>

<p><i>Gram’s Method.</i>&mdash;Sections are stained for ten minutes in a
capsule containing aniline-gentian-violet solution, then placed in the
iodine and iodide solution until uniformly brown, then placed in
absolute alcohol, and washed by carefully moving sections in the
liquid with a glass rod. When completely decolourised, they are
transferred to clove oil and then to a slide.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span></p>

<p>Double-staining is obtained by transferring the sections after
decolourisation to eosin, Bismarck brown, or vesuvin (Crookshank).</p>

<p><i>Formalin</i> is an excellent preservative fluid; one part to 20,000 is
sufficient to prevent fermentation. For the preservation of vegetable
sections, a one per cent. solution is required; even the fresh
appearance of vegetable structures is preserved for some time when
immersed in it. In the nutrient gelatine for biological specimens,
if used early, will arrest the liquefaction of the gelatine by bacteria.
For hardening it saves time, and is even better than alcohol,
chromic acid, pot. bich., and many others. It does not cause
shrinkage of the cells. Tissue &frac12; to &frac34; inch thick hardens in
twenty-four hours in pure formalin; five to ten per cent. is best for
loose tissue. In another method, by which time can be saved,
instead of placing the specimen in the <i>formalin</i> and afterwards in
mucilage, prior to cutting sections, make the mucilage with two per
cent. (or stronger) formalin water, and it will then answer both
purposes at the same time.</p>

<h3>Preparing, Mounting, Cementing and Collecting Objects.</h3>

<p>Various materials are required for preparing and mounting
microscopic objects, as slips of glass, patent flatted plate measuring
3 &times; 1 inch, thin glass covers, glass cells, preservative media,
varnishes, cements, a glazier’s diamond, and a Shadbolt’s turn-table.</p>

<p>The glass slides and covers, although sent out packed ready for
use, should be immersed in an alkaline solution to ensure perfect
freedom from any greasiness derived from touching by the fingers.
Dr. Seller recommends a particular solution for this purpose. (See
<i>Formul&aelig;</i>, Appendix.)</p>

<p>Varnishes and cements must be selected with care, as these are
not only expected to adhere firmly to the glass slide, but also to resist
the action of the preservative fluid in which the specimen may be
mounted. Among the numerous preparations employed, I may
enumerate Canada balsam, gum dammar, Venice turpentine,
Japanners’ gold size, used for closing up cells, asphalte varnish,
Brunswick black, shellac, glue and honey, Hollis’ liquid glue, and
marine glue. To give a finish to the mounted specimen, coloured
varnishes are sometimes resorted to. A red varnish of sealing-wax is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
made by digesting powdered sealing-wax in strong alcohol. Filter,
and place the solution in a dish, and evaporate by means of a sand
bath to reduce it to a proper consistency. This is said to resist
the action of cedar oil. For white, zinc, cement is the best. This
is made of benzole, gum dammar, oxide of zinc, and turpentine.
Cole gives another formula, but either of these may be obtained of
Squire, who supplies every kind of staining and mounting material.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_262" src="images/fig_262.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 262.&mdash;Walmsley’s Cell-making Turn-table.</p></div>

<p><i>Cells for Mounting.</i>&mdash;The minuter forms of life should be
mounted in thin cells, which may be readily made with Japanners’
gold size, dammar or asphalte, and a Shadbolt or Walmsley’s turntable.
The glass slide being placed under the metal springs in such
a manner that its two ends shall be equi-distant from the centre
(a guide to the position is afforded by the circles traced out on the
brass), take a camel’s hair pencil and dip it into the Japanner’s
gold-size, holding it firmly between the finger and thumb, and set
the wheel in motion, when a perfect circle will be formed; put it
aside to dry, or place it in the warm chamber to harden. To cut
cover-glasses place a sheet of thin glass under the brass springs, and
substitute for the pencil a cutting diamond. A cutting diamond
is not only useful to the microscopist for the above purpose,
but also for writing the names of mounted objects on one end of
the slide.</p>

<p>It will be found convenient to make a number of such cells, and
keep a stock ready for use. There are many objects whose structure
is very transparent. These should be mounted dry. Scales from the
wings of butterflies and moths, of the podura and lepisma, and some
of the diatomace&aelig; are of this class. All that is necessary in
preparing objects for dry mounting is to take care that they are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
free from extraneous matter, and fix them permanently in the
position in which their structure will show to the best advantage.</p>

<p>For mounting specimens of greater thickness it is desirable to
use deeper cells. It will then be found convenient to make a second
or a third application of the gold-size, allowing sufficient time
between applications for the varnish to dry. Cells of a still deeper
kind are made up by cementing rings of glass or metal to the glass-slides
with marine glue or Brunswick black. The latter will be
rendered more durable by mixing in a small quantity of indiarubber
varnish (made by dissolving small strips of caoutchouc in gas-tar).
The process of mounting in glass-cells is similar to that employed in
making varnish-cells, except that a somewhat larger quantity of
cementing medium is required. Objects mounted in this way should
be kept for a time in the horizontal position, and a little fresh
varnish must be applied if the cement shows a tendency to crack.
In mounting objects in balsam, care must
be taken to have the specimen <i>quite dry</i>
before transferring it to turpentine. Objects
mounted in cells should become <i>perfectly
saturated</i> with the mounting fluid before
being finally cemented down.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_263" src="images/fig_263.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 263.&mdash;Glass-cells for
Mounting.</p></div>

<p>It is preferable to mount and preserve
specimens of animal tissues in shallow cells, to avoid undue pressure
on the preparation. Cells intended to contain preparations immersed
in fluid must be made of a substance impervious to the fluid used,
such as here represented (<a href="#fig_263">Fig. 263</a>). The surface of the fixed glass-circle
should be slightly roughened before applying the cement.</p>

<p>Different modes of mounting may be employed with advantage;
for instance, entomological specimens, as legs, wings, spiracles,
trache&aelig;, ovipositors, stings, tongues, palates, corne&aelig;, should be
mounted in balsam; the trachea of the house-cricket, however, should
be mounted dry. Sections of bone may either be mounted dry or
in a fluid. Other objects, as sections of wood and stones of fruit,
exhibit their structure best in Canada balsam.</p>

<p>In mounting entomological specimens, the first thing, of course,
is the dissection of the insect. This is best accomplished by the aid
of a dissecting microscope, a pair of small brass forceps, and finely-pointed
scissors; the parts to be prepared and mounted should first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
be carefully detached from the insect with the scissors, then immersed
in a solution of caustic alkali (<i>liquor potass&aelig;</i>) for a few days, to soften
and dissolve out the fat and soft parts. The length of time necessary
for their immersion can only be determined by experience, but, as a
general rule, the objects assume a certain amount of transparency
when they have been long enough in the alkali; when this is ascertained,
the object must be placed in a proper receptacle and put by
to soak for two or three hours in soft or distilled water. It should
then be placed between two slips of glass, and gently pressed till
the softer parts are removed. Should any adhere to the edge of the
object, it will be necessary to wash the specimen carefully in water,
a process that will be much assisted by the delicate touches of a
camel’s-hair brush. Place the object now and then under the microscope
to see that all extraneous matter is removed, and when this is
accomplished take the specimen up
carefully with the camel’s-hair brush,
or a lifter, and place it on a piece of
very smooth paper (thick ivory note is
the best for the purpose), arrange it
carefully with the brush and a finely
pointed needle, place a second piece of
paper over it, and press it flat between
two slips of glass, and compress it by a
small spring clip (<a href="#fig_264">Fig. 264</a>). A dozen clips may be had for a few pence.
When <i>thoroughly</i> dry (which it will probably be in about twenty-four
hours, if in a warm room), separate the glasses, and gently unfold the
paper; then, with a little careful manipulation, the object may be
readily detached, and placed in a little spirit of turpentine, where it
should be allowed to remain until rendered transparent and fit for
mounting. The time during which it should remain in this liquid
will depend on the structure; some objects, such as wings of flies,
will be quickly permeated, while horny and dense objects require an
immersion of a fortnight or even longer. A pomatum pot with
a <i>concave</i> bottom and well-fitting lid will answer admirably for
conducting the soaking process in; and it is well, in preparing
several specimens at a time, to have two pots, one for large and
medium, the other for very small objects, otherwise the smaller will
adhere to the larger.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_264" src="images/fig_264.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 264.&mdash;Spring Clip for
Mounting.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span></p></div>

<p>In mounting objects in fluid, the glass cover should come nearly,
but <i>not quite</i>, to the edge of the cell, a slight margin being left for
the cement, which should project slightly over the edge of the cover,
in order to secure it to the cell.</p>

<p><i>Media for Preserving Alg&aelig;.</i>&mdash;The most useful preservative media
for alg&aelig; are chrome-alum, formalin, and camphor water. The
solution should consist of one per cent. of chrome-alum and one per
cent. of formalin; this will render the gelatinous sheath and matrix
form clear, while it will retain the colour of the alg&aelig; in most cases.
The Chlorophyce&aelig; do well in any of these media; but other species,
as <i>Ulva Lactuca</i>, are rendered somewhat brittle. For such use
formalin alone. The Ph&aelig;ophyce&aelig; should be placed while fresh in
the formalin; the larger forms are better fixed by placing them for
an hour or two in chrome-alum solution. The Floride&aelig; do well in
any of the three solutions, but the more delicate species, <i>Griffithsia</i>,
require a two per cent. formalin solution in sea-water; the plant
preserves its natural appearance in this medium.</p>

<p>To preserve and mount diatomace&aelig; in as nearly as possible
a natural condition, they should be first well washed in distilled
water and mounted in a medium composed of one part of spirits of
wine to seven parts of distilled water. The siliceous coverings of
the diatoms, however, which show various beautiful forms under
the higher powers of the microscope, require more care in preparation.
The guano, or infusorial earth containing them, should first
be washed several times in water till the water is colourless, allowing
sufficient time for precipitation between each washing. The deposit
must then be put into a test tube and nitro-hydrochloric acid (equal
parts of nitric and hydrochloric acids) added to it, when a violent
effervescence will take place. When this has subsided, the whole
should be subjected to heat, brought nearly to the boiling point for
six or eight hours. The acid must now be carefully poured off, and
the precipitate washed in a <i>large</i> quantity of water, allowing some
three or four hours between each washing, for the subsidence of
some of the lighter forms. The sediment must be examined under
the microscope with an inch object-glass, and the siliceous valves of
the diatoms picked out with a coarse hair or bristle.</p>

<p>Dr. Rezner’s Mechanical Finger (<a href="#fig_265">Fig. 265</a>) for selecting and
arranging diatoms, adaptable to any microscope, is made to slip on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
to the objective far enough to have a firm bearing, and so that the
bristle point can be brought into focus when depressed to its limit.
It is clamped in its place by a small thumb-screw. The bristle
holder slides into its place, and is carefully adjusted to the centre
of the field. When using the finger, the bristle is first raised by
means of the micrometer screw till so far within focus as to be nearly
or quite invisible, then the objective is focussed on to the slide, and
the desired object sought for and brought into the centre of the
field; the bristle point is then lowered by the screw until it reaches
the object, which usually adheres to it at once, and can then be
examined by rotating the bristle wire by means of the milled head.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_265" src="images/fig_265.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 265.&mdash;Rezner’s Mechanical Finger.</p></div>

<p>The medium used for mounting diatomace&aelig; is of considerable
importance, inasmuch as their visibility is either diminished or much
increased thereby. Professor Abbe, experimenting with the more
minute test objects, diatoms, &amp;c., found monobromide of naphthaline
gave increased definition to most of them. This liquid is
colourless, somewhat of an oleaginous nature, and is soluble in
alcohol. Its density is 1·555, and refractive index 1·6. Its index
of visibility is about twice that of Canada balsam.</p>

<p>Taking the refractive index of air as 1·0, and diatomaceous silex
as 1·43, the visibility may be expressed by the <i>difference</i> ·43.</p>

<p>The following table may be constructed :&mdash;</p>

<p>These data relating to visibility must be taken in connection with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
the numerical aperture of the objectives and of the illuminating
pencil. The effect produced on diatoms is very remarkable, the
markings on their siliceous frustules being visible under much lower
powers.</p>

<p>So that the visibility of the diatom mounted in phosphorus as
compared with balsam is as sixty-seven to eleven; in other words,
the image is six times more visible. Mr. Stephenson’s phosphorus
medium is composed of a solution of solid or stick phosphorous
dissolved in bisulphide of carbon. Great care is required in preparing
the solution owing to the very inflammable nature of the materials.
So small a quantity of the bisulphide of carbon is required to dissolve
the phosphorus that the diatom may be said to be mounted in nearly
pure phosphorus. Remarkable enough, this medium has the reverse
effect upon such test-objects as podura and lepisma scales. These
lose their characteristic markings.</p>

<p>For mounting minute objects, carbolic acid solution will be found
a useful medium&mdash;the purest crystals of carbolic acid dissolved in
just sufficient water to render them fluid. No more should be dissolved
than may be wanted for the time being, as if left standing
exposed to the light it changes colour. Small crustacean foraminifera,
the palates of moluscs, after boiling a short time in liquid potash
and well washing to remove all traces of alkali, may be preserved in
carbolic acid solution. Should the specimens appear cloudy gently
warm the slide over a spirit lamp.</p>

<p><i>Preserving and Killing Rotatoria with cilia in situ.</i>&mdash;Mr. C.
Rousselet’s method of preserving and mounting the Rotatoria<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> has
been attended with so much success that the old difficulty attendant
upon the preservation of these various beautiful forms of infusorial
life has been practically overcome. The process resorted to consists
of four stages, namely, narcotising, killing, fixing, and preserving.
In dealing with rotifers hitherto, the difficulty has been that of
successfully killing them with their rotating organs fully extended.
It has been found needful to have recourse in the first instance to
a narcotising agent, and one that acts slowly. The most suitable
is a weak solution of the hydrochlorate of cocaine, a one per cent.
solution, or even weaker. This was first proposed by Mr. Weber for
keeping these active little bodies quiet while under observation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
Mr. Rousselet carries this agent further; he applied it to narcotise
them prior to killing, and this it does most effectually. The rotifers
are seen to sink to the bottom of the live-cell, and the cilia gradually
to slacken in motion, and the time for killing has arrived. This is
effected by Flemming’s chromo-aceto-osmic acid. A rather weak
solution must be employed&mdash;consisting of 1 per cent. solution of
chromic acid, 15 parts; 2 per cent. osmic acid, 4 parts; glacial acetic
acid, 1 part&mdash;which is at the same time a killing and fixing medium.
The word “fixing” must not be taken to imply simply fixing, as
it includes rapidly <i>killing</i> and <i>hardening</i> and preventing further
change in the tissues of the rotifers by subsequent treatment, as
mounting. The animal, therefore, must remain quietly for a few
minutes, and then taken out and washed in five or six changes of
distilled water, and hence transferred to the preservative fluid.
All this must be effected with great care. The best preservative
fluid is simply distilled water, rendered antiseptic by a trace of the
fixing solution (about eight drops to an ounce of water) giving the
slightest tinge of yellow to the solution. This slight tinge of colour
is imparted to the rotifers, otherwise they remain transparent and
unchanged, while the nervous tissue throughout the body is brought
out to perfection.</p>

<p>Some slight difference in treatment is required by certain species,
as that of <i>Asplanchna priodonta</i>; after the application of the cocaine
solution, which should be added slowly, that is, by letting a few
drops trickle down the side of the live-trough; this, being heavier
than water, sinks to the bottom, thus narcotising the rotifers, and
assisting to kill them with the cilia fully expanded. They should be
left quietly for fifteen minutes, then thoroughly washed with distilled
water. On further experimenting, Mr. Rousselet found that a
weaker solution of osmic acid alone, &frac14; per cent., answers quite as
well as, if not better than, Flemming’s fluid; even this must be allowed
to act for only a very short time&mdash;a minute at most; the rotifers
then remain white and transparent, excepting the ova, in which
a fat-like substance, <i>lecithene</i>, is secreted. If they become too much
stained, they may be decolourised by passing them through peroxide
of hydrogen. For narcotising the following solution has been found
most useful:&mdash;Take a 2 per cent. solution of cocaine hydrochlorate,
3 parts; methylated spirit of wood naphtha, 1 part; and distilled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
water, 6 parts. This must be added as before directed, drop by
drop, watching the effect upon the rotifers under the microscope.</p>

<p>All the rotatoria may be killed and preserved in the same way.
For mounting, Mr. Rousselet prefers a slightly <i>hollowed-out</i> glass cell,
the advantage of which is that the rotifers are kept to the centre,
and cannot move to the edge. A little difficulty at first presents
itself to exclude air-bubbles, but this, with a little care, can be overcome
by placing a drop of a two or three per cent. solution of
formalin, just sufficient to fill the cell. Then transfer the rotifers
with a dipping pipette to the cell, and lower the cover-glass down
very gently, removing any excess of fluid by blotting-paper. The
best cement for the cover-glass is gold-size.</p>

<p><i>Method of Cementing.</i>&mdash;After many years’ experience, I have
arrived at the conclusion that for cementing down the cover-glass
there is nothing better than either gold size or gum dammar varnish.
The latter, for some preparations, will be improved by the addition
of a small proportion of indiarubber dissolved in naphtha. (See
Appendix.)</p>

<p>Should glycerine be preferred, carefully wash away any surplus
quantity by gently syringing; then apply a ring of waterproof
cement round the cover-glass. An inexpensive one can be made
by dissolving ten grains of gum-ammoniac in an ounce of acetic
acid, and adding to this solution two drachms of Cox’s gelatine.
This liquid flows easily from the brush and is waterproof, rendered
more so if subsequently brushed over with a solution of ten grains of
bichromate of potash in an ounce of water. An especial recommendation
to this cement is its adhesiveness to glass, even should
there be a little glycerine left behind on the cover. After the
gelatine ring is thoroughly dry any kind of cement may be employed.</p>

<p>A useful cement for fixing minute objects, diatoms, &amp;c., temporarily
to thin glass covers, before permanently mounting them in Canada
balsam, is made as follows:&mdash;Dissolve, without heat, two or three
grains of gum arabic in one ounce of distilled water, then add glacial
acetic acid, three minims, and the least trace of sugar. Filter
carefully through filter paper, and repeat this in the course of three
or four weeks. This cement will be unaffected by the balsam.</p>

<p><i>Mounting Chara.</i>&mdash;It is often found difficult to preserve and
mount the fruit of chara, but this can be successfully accomplished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
in glycerine jelly, by taking the following precautions. After
cleaning the specimen place it in 92 per cent. of alcohol for several
hours, then transfer it to a mixture of equal parts of spirit and
glycerine for several hours longer, pour off nearly all the mixture,
and add pure glycerine at intervals till the glycerine becomes
concentrated. The specimen is then mounted in glycerine jelly in a
cell just deep enough to take it without pressure.</p>

<p>There are some objects much more difficult to prepare than others,
and which tax the patience of the beginner in a manner which can
hardly be imagined by any one who has never made the attempt.
The structure of many creatures is so delicate as to require the
very greatest care to prevent mutilation, and consequent spoliation,
of the specimen. The beginner, therefore, must not be discouraged
by a few failures in commencing, but should persevere in his
attempts, and constant practice will soon teach him the best way
of managing intricate and difficult objects. The room in which he
operates should be free from dust, smoke, and intrusion, and everything
used should be kept scrupulously clean, since a very small
speck of dirt, which may be almost invisible to the naked eye, will
assume unpleasant proportions under the microscope, and not only
mar, but possibly spoil a fine and delicate preparation.</p>

<p>Few students on commencing to work with the microscope will
fully realise the fact that under medium or high powers the natural
appearance of almost all objects is changed by the refractive nature
of the fluid medium in which they are immersed and which
enters more or less into their composition. The remarkable changes
effected by the law of diffusion, when alkaloid substances enter into
their composition, show the necessity of taking every precaution
in the employment of preservative fluids. Glycerine affords an
example of the chemical change induced, should the preparation
have been passed through an alkaline solution.</p>

<p><i>Air Bubbles</i> are a constant source of annoyance both in preparing
and mounting. These may be removed from the specimen by gently
warming the under part of the slide over a spirit lamp, or placing
the slide in the warm chamber, when the bubbles will move towards
the edge of the cover-glass and ultimately disappear. The air-pump
is preferred by many microscopists.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span></p>

<h3>Collection of Objects.</h3>

<p><i>Infusorial Life</i>, with all its fascinations, was fully unveiled to
naturalists by the celebrated Ehrenberg. It was he who termed
it infusorial, because he first met with the more interesting forms
of minute life in infusions of hay and other vegetable substances.
Since his day it is a well-known experience of those who take up
the microscope that the most interesting objects to commence with
are infusorial living creatures of sufficient dimensions to be easily
understood and seen with moderate magnifying powers. Moreover,
infusoria are more readily found in almost any pool or running
stream of water, either near the surface or clinging to the under
surfaces of aquatic plants. At one time all the small shallow pools
in the neighbourhood of London&mdash;Hampstead Heath, Clapham,
Wandsworth, and other commons&mdash;abounded in the most interesting
forms of life, were famous hunting grounds for the marvellous
volvox, the charming dismid and diatom, the wonderful
budding and self-dividing hydra. A few hours’ ramble furnished
the microscopist with a bountiful supply of these and many other
forms of life. Now all is changed; our commons have been devoted
to other purposes, and with the general <i>levelling</i> up all the little
pools have disappeared, and the microscopist has been warned off
and driven further afield, or seeks the good offices of a country
friend for an occasional peep into pond life.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>A teaspoonful, however, judiciously taken from a well-chosen
locality will often be found to contain a variety of living forms,
every one of which will deserve a careful and patient study.</p>

<p>Of the microscopic organisms, the collection of which requires no
other methods than those ordinarily pursued by the naturalist, most
of them must be sought for in pools or running waters, basking in
the sunshine, clinging to leaves and rootlets of all aquatic plants;
some freely moving about, others clinging to stones or pieces of
wood at the bottom. Dismids congregate in shallow waters or rise
to the surface in a quiet nook, while the diatomace&aelig; are seen
covering the bottom of clear water, to which they give a yellowish-brown
tinge of colour.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>

<p>Infusorial animal life, as vorticell&aelig;, stentors, rotifers, and various
polyzoa, cling, as also do hydra, in colonies to vallisneria, duck-weed,
frogbit, or small branches dipping down under water; and if some
of the water-weed is brought home the little creatures will live and
thrive for several weeks. No waters, however, are so full of minute
animal life as the sphagnum bog. A number of species of diatoms,
as well as protozoids and the smaller molluscs, will be found in all
peat bogs. It is remarkable, too, that the same species, everywhere,
are associated with this kind of moss. Lord Sidney Godolphin
Osborn supplied his friends with moss growing in a damp part of
the garden walk of his rectory; this always furnished the same
species of rotifers. These proved to be most interesting objects to
my friends, and in an early communication I described them as
<i>indestructible</i>, since they will bear any amount of desiccation;
nevertheless, they were revived when a drop of water was introduced
into the glass-cell.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 266.&mdash;Collecting Stick, Bottle, Hook, and Net.</p></div>

<p>The Thames mud always furnishes a number of beautiful forms of
triceratum. Lower down the river, as brackish water is reached,
greater varieties of diatoms appear. But to secure them the
collector must be provided with a collecting stick. A convenient
form is furnished by Messrs. Baker (<a href="#fig_266">Fig. 266</a>). This consists of an
ordinary walking-stick, together with a lengthening rod, a cutting
hook to clear away weeds, ringed bottles with screw tops, and
a net with a glass tube attached. Their uses are too obvious to
need further description.</p>

<p>The siliceous skeletons of diatoms are met with in the fossil state.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
Among the first discovered of the infusorial strata were the polishing
slates of Bilin and Tripoli, the berg-mehl or mountain meal, the
entire mass of which is composed of the siliceous skeletons of
different species of diatoms. Richmond, Virginia, is rich in the same
organisms, while the great mass of our chalk cliffs are composed of
foraminiferous shells, xanthidi&aelig;, &amp;c. One remarkable fact in connection
with fossil infusoria is that most of the forms are still found in
the recent state. The beautiful engine-turned discs, <i>Coscinodisci</i>, so
abundant in the Richmond earth, may be met with in our own
seas, and in great profusion in the deposits of guano on the African
and American coasts, and in the stomachs of the oyster, scallop, and
other salt-water molluscous animals common to our shores.</p>

<p>A great number of infusorial earths may be mounted as dry
objects, while others require careful washing and digesting in
appropriate media. The finer portions of the sediments will be
found to contain the better and more perfect siliceous shells.

<h3>Microscopic Forms of Life&mdash;Thallophytes&mdash;Pteridophyta,
Phanerogam&aelig;&mdash;Structure and Properties of the Cell.</h3>

<p>The time has long since passed by since the value of the microscope
as an instrument of scientific research might have been
called in question. By its aid the foundation of mycology has
been securely laid, and cryptogamic botany in particular has,
during the last quarter of a century, made surprising progress in
the hands of those devoted to pursuits which confer benefits upon
mankind.</p>

<p>Little more than thirty years ago practically nothing was known
of the life history of a fungus, nothing of parasitism, of infectious
diseases, or even of fermentation. Our knowledge of the physiology
of nutrition was in its infancy; even the significance of starches and
sugars in the green plant was as yet not understood, while a number
of the most important facts relating to plants and the physiology of
animals were unknown and undiscovered. When we reflect on these
matters, and remember that bacteria were regarded merely as curious
animalcul&aelig;, that rusts and smuts were supposed to be emanations of
diseased states, and that spontaneous generation still-survived among
us, some idea may be formed of the condition of cryptogamic botany
and the lower forms of animal life some eight or ten years after my
book on the microscope made its first appearance (1854).</p>

<p>Indeed, long prior to this time, dating from that of even the
earliest workers with the microscope, it was known that the water
of pools and ditches, and especially infusions of plants and animals
of all kinds, teem with living organisms, but it was not recognised
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
definitely that vast numbers of these microscopic living beings (and
even actively moving ones) are plants, growing on and in the various
solid and liquid matters examined, and as truly as visible and
accepted plants grow on soil and in the air and water. Perhaps
the most important discovery in the history of cryptogamic botany
was initiated here. The change, then, that has come over our knowledge
of microscopic plant life during this last busy quarter of a
century has been almost entirely due to the initiation and improvement,
first in methods of growing them, and in the methods of
“<i>Microscopic Gardening</i>”; and secondly, to the greater knowledge
gained in the use of the microscope.</p>

<p>“If we look at the great groups of plants from a broad point
of view, it is remarkable that the fungi and the phanerogams
occupy attention on quite other grounds than do the alg&aelig;, mosses,
and ferns. Alg&aelig; are especially a physiologist’s group, employed in
questions on nutrition, reproduction, and cell division and growth;
the Bryophyta and Pteridophyta are, on the other hand, the domain
of the morphologist. Fungi and Phanerogams, while equally or even
more employed by specialists in morphology and physiology, appeal
widely to general interest on the ground of utility.</p>

<p>“It is very significant that a group like the fungi should have
attracted so much scientific attention, and aroused so general an interest
at the same time. But the fact that fungi affect our lives directly has
been driven home; and whether as poisons or foods, destructive
moulds or fermentation agents, parasitic mildews or disease germs,
they occupy more interest than all other cryptogams put together,
the flowering plants alone rivalling them in this respect. A marked
feature of the period in which we live will be the great advances
made in our knowledge of the uses of plants, for, of course, this
development of economic botany has gone hand in hand with
the progress of geological botany, the extension of our planting,
and the useful applications of botany to the processes of home
industries.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>The intimate organic structure of the vegetable world is seen to
consist of a variety of different materials indeterminable by unassisted
vision, and for the most part requiring high magnification for their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
discrimination. Chemical analysis had, however, shown that vegetables
are composed of a few simple substances, water, carbonic acid
gas, oxygen, nitric acid, and a small portion of inorganic salts. Out
of these simple elements the whole of the immense variety of
substances produced by the vegetable kingdom are constructed.
No part of the plant contains fewer than three of these universally
distributed elements, hence the greater uniformity in their chemical
constituents. It will be seen, then, that the methods of plant
chemistry are of supreme interest both to the chemist and the
physiologist, or biologist. Plants, while they borrow materials from
the inorganic, and powers from the physical world, whereby they
are enabled to pass through the several stages of germination, growth,
and reproduction, could not accomplish these transformations without
the all-important aid of light and heat, the combined functions of
which are indispensable to the perfect development of the vegetable
world.</p>

<p>Light, then, enables plants to decompose, change into living matter,
and consolidate, the inorganic elements of carbonic acid gas, water,
and ammonia, which are absorbed by the leaves and roots from the
atmosphere and earth; the quantity of carbon consolidated being
exactly in proportion to the intensity of the light. Nevertheless,
light in its chemical character is a deoxidising agent, by which the
numerous neutral compounds common to vegetables are formed. It
is the principal agent in preparing the food of plants, and it is during
the chemical changes spoken of that the specific heat of plants
is slowly evolved, which, though generally feeble, is sometimes very
sensibly evolved, especially so when flowers and fruits are forming,
on account of the increase of chemical energy at this period.</p>

<p>The action of heat is measurable throughout the whole course of
vegetable life, although its manifestations take on various forms&mdash;those
suited to the period and circumstances of growth. Upon the heat
generated depends the formation of protein and nitrogenous substances,
which abound more directly in the seed buds, the points of the roots,
and in all those organs of plants which are in the greatest state of
activity. The whole chemistry of plant life, in fact, is manifest in
this production of energy for drawing material from its surroundings;
therefore the organising power of plants bears a direct ratio to the
amount of light and heat acting upon them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span></p>

<p>The living medium, then, which possesses the marvellous property
of being primarily aroused into life and energy, and which either forms
the whole or the greater portion of every plant, is in its earliest and
simplest form nothing more than a microscopic cell, consisting of one or
two colourless particles of matter, in closest contact, and wholly immersed
in a transparent substance somewhat resembling <i>albumen</i> (white
of egg), termed <i>protoplasm</i>, but differing essentially in its character
and properties. This nearly colourless organisable matter is the life-blood
of the cell. It is sufficiently viscid to maintain its globular
form, and under high powers is seen to have a slightly consolidated
film enclosing semi-transparent particles, together with vacuoles
which are of a highly refractive nature. These small bodies are
termed nuclei, and they appear to be furnished with an extremely
delicate enveloping film. In a short time the nuclei increase in
number and split up the parent body. The protoplasmic mass,
however, is undoubtedly the true formative material, and is rightly
regarded as “the physical basis of life” of both the vegetable and
animal kingdoms.</p>

<p>There are, however, certain members of the vegetable kingdom
which somewhat resemble animals in their dependence upon
receiving organic compounds already formed for them, being themselves
unable to effect the fixation of the carbon needed to effect
the first stage in their after chemical transformations. Such is the
case with a large class of flowering plants, among Phanerogams,
and the leafless parasites which draw their support chiefly from
the tissues of their hosts. It is likewise the case with regard to
the whole group of fungi; the lower cryptogams, which derive the
greater portion of their nutritive materials from organic matter
undergoing some form of histolysis; while others belonging to this
group have the power of originating decomposition by a fermentative
(<i>zymotic</i>) action peculiarly their own. There are many other
protophytes which live by absorption, and which appear to take in
no solid matter, but draw nourishment from the atmosphere or the
water in which they exist.</p>

<p>With regard to motion, this was at one time considered the
distinctive attribute of animal life, but many protophytes possess a
spontaneity of power and motion, while others are furnished with
curious motile organs termed <i>cilia</i>, or whip-like appendages, <i>flagella</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
by which their bodies are propelled with considerable force through
the water in which they live.</p>

<p>Henceforth this protoplasmic substance was destined to take an
important position in the physiological world. It is, then, desirable
to enter somewhat more fully into the life history of so remarkable a
body. It has a limiting membrane, composed of a substance somewhat
allied to starch, termed <i>cellulose</i>, one of the group of compounds
known as carbo-hydrates. The mode of formation and growth of this
cell wall is not yet definitely determined; nevertheless, it is the
universal framework or skeleton of the vegetable world, although
it appears to play no special part in their vital functions. It
merely serves the purpose of a protecting membrane to the globular
body called the “<i>primordial cell</i>,” which permanently constitutes the
living principle upon which the whole fundamental phenomena of
growth and reproduction depend.</p>

<p>Sometimes this protoplasmic material is seen to constitute the
whole plant; and so with regard to the simplest known forms of
animal life&mdash;the amœba, for example. That so simple and minute
an organism should be capable of independent motion is indeed
surprising. Dujardin, a French physiologist, termed this animated
matter <i>sarcode</i>. On a closer study of the numerous forms of animal
life it was found that all were alike composed of this sarcode
substance, some apparently not having a cell wall. The same seemed
to hold good of certain higher forms of cells, the colourless blood
corpuscles for instance, which under high powers of the microscope
are seen to change their shape, moving about by the streaming
out of this sarcode. At length the truth dawned on histologists
that the cell contents, rather than the closing wall, must be the
essential structure. On further investigation it became apparent that
a far closer similarity existed between vegetables and animals than was
before supposed. Ultimately it was made clear that the vegetable
protoplasm and the animal sarcode were one and the same structure.
Max Schultz found this to be the case, and to all intents and purposes
they are identical.</p>

<p>We have now to retrace our steps and look somewhat more closely
into the discovery of that important body, the <i>cell-nucleus</i>. It
was an English botanist, Dr. Robert Brown, who, in 1833, during
his microscopical studies of the epidermis of orchids, discovered in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
their cells “an opaque spot,” to which soon afterwards he gave the
name of <i>nucleus</i>. Schleiden and Schwann’s later researches led them
to the conclusion that the nucleus is the most characteristic formative
element in all vegetable and animal tissues in the incipient
phase of existence. It then began to be taught that there is one
universal principle of development for the elementary parts of all organisms,
however different, and that is the formation of cells. Thus was
enunciated a doctrine which was for all practical purposes absolutely
new, and which opened out a wide field of further investigation for
the physiologist, and led up to a fuller knowledge of the cell contents.
In fact, it became a question as to whether the cell contents rather
than the enclosing wall should not be considered the basis of life,
since the cell at this time had by no means lost its importance,
although it no longer signified the minute cavity it did when
originally discovered by Schwann. It now implied, as Schultz
defined it, “a small mass of viscid matter, protoplasm, endowed
with the attributes of life.” The nucleus was once more restored
to its original importance, and with even greater significance. In
place of being a structure generated <i>de novo</i> from non-cellular substance,
and disappearing as soon as its function of cell formation is
accomplished, the nucleus is now known as the central permanent
feature of every cell, and indestructible while the cell lives, and
the parent, by division of its substance, of other generations of
nuclei and cells. The word <i>cell</i> has at the same time received
its final definition as “a small mass of protoplasm supplied with
a nucleus.” In short, all the activities of plant and animal life
are really the product of energy liberated solely through <i>histolysis</i>,
or destructive processes, amounting to the combustion that takes
place in the ultimate cells of the organisms.</p>

<p>But there are other points of especial interest involved in the
question of cell formation beside those already mentioned.</p>

<p>The cell and its contents collectively are termed the <i>endoplasm</i>,
or when coloured, as in alg&aelig;, <i>endochrome</i>. With regard to the outer
layer of the cell and its growth nothing satisfactory has been clearly
determined and finally accepted.</p>

<p>The cell as a whole is a protoplasmic mass, and not an emulsion,
as some observers would have us suppose. It is, in fact, a reticulated
tissue of the most delicate structure, made up of canaliculate spiral
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
fibrils with hyaline walls capable of expansion and contraction.
These fibrils are probably composed of still finer spirals. The visible
granulated portion of the protoplasm, the only part that takes a
stain under ordinary circumstances, is simply the contents of these
canals. It is the chromatin of Flemming, and is capable of motion
within the canals. The nucleus, then, is probably nothing more
than a granule of the extra-cellular net, and is formed by the
junction of the several bands of wall-threads which traverse it in
different directions. The cell wall of plants possesses the same
structure as protoplasm, and is probably protoplasm impregnated
by cellulose.</p>

<p>It is this portion of the protoplasmic mass that is now recognised
under the term <i>octoplasm</i>, or primordial utricle, and is of so fine and
delicate a nature that it is only brought into view when separated
from the cell wall either by further developmental changes, or by
reagents and certain stains or dyes. It was, in fact, discovered to be
a slightly condensed portion of the protoplasmic layer corresponding
to the <i>octosare</i> of the lower forms of animal life. The octoplasm and
cell wall can only be distinguished from each other by chemical tests.
Both nucleus and nucleoli are only rendered visible in the same way,
that is, by staining for several hours in a carmine solution, and
washing in a weak acetic acid solution.</p>

<p>With the enlargement of the cell by the imbibition of water,
clear spaces, termed vacuoles, are seen to occupy a small portion
of the cell, while the nucleus and nucleoli lie close to the parietal
layer.</p>

<p>The interesting phenomenon of cyclosis, to which I shall have
occasion to refer further on, is now believed to be due to the
contractility of certain wall-threads stretching from the nucleus
to the outermost layers of the cell. An intimate relationship is
thereby established between the nucleus, the nucleolus, and the
parietal layer. This much has been made clear by the more
scientific methods of investigation pursued in the use of the
microscope. Nevertheless a large and important class of cells,
forming a kind of borderland between the vegetable and animal
kingdoms, still remains to be dealt with, in which the cell
contents are only imperfectly differentiated, while numerous
other unicellular organisms, owing to their extreme minuteness,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
tenuity, and want of all colour, are apparently devoid of any
nucleus, and when present can only be differentiated by a resort
to a specially conducted method of preparation and staining.
There is, however, a remarkable feature in connection with many
micro-organisms&mdash;that certain of these protophytes possess motive
organs, cilia or flagella, bodies at one time supposed to be characteristic
of, and belonging to, the protozoa.</p>

<p>This being the case, the methods of plant chemistry are of supreme
interest, the more so because physiologists are in a position to
isolate a single bacterial cell, grow it in certain media, and thus
devote special attention to it, and keep it for some time under
observation. In this way it has become possible to further grasp
facts in connection with cell nutrition and the nature of its waste
products. We have, then, arrived at a stage when the history of the
chemical changes brought about by bacteria can be more definitely
determined, as we have here to do with the vegetable cell in its
simplest form. The chemical work performed by these micro-organisms
has as yet occupied only a few years; nevertheless,
the results have been of the most remarkable and encouraging
character.</p>

<p>At an earlier period an interesting discovery in connection with the
pathogenic action of these bodies was, by the labours of Sch&ouml;enlein,
Robin, and others, brought to the notice of the medical profession,
viz., that certain diseases affecting the human body were due to
vegetable parasites. In 1856 an opportunity offered itself for a
thorough investigation, and the microscopical part of the work fell
into my hands, with the result that I was able to add considerably
to Sch&ouml;enlein’s list of parasitic skin diseases. My observations were
in the first instance communicated to the medical journals. But the
generalisation arrived at was that “If there be any exceptions to
the law that parasites select for their sustenance the subjects of
debility and decay, such exceptions are rarely to be found among
the vegetations belonging to fungi, which invariably derive nutrition
from matter in a state of lowered vitality, passing into degeneration,
or wherein decomposition has already taken place to a certain extent....
It scarcely admits of a doubt that all diseases observed
of late years among plants have been due to parasites of the same
class favoured by want of vigour of growth and atmospheric conditions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
and that the cause of the various murrains of which so much
has been heard is also due to similar causes.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>Herein, then, is to be found the solution of a difficulty that so
long surrounded the question, but which subsequently culminated in
the specialisation and scientific development of bacteriology, due to
the unceasing labours of Pasteur, whose solid genius enabled him to
overcome the prejudices of those who were at work on other lines,
and who had no conception of the functions that parasitic organisms
fulfil in nature.</p>

<p>Going back to my earlier experimental researches to determine
the part taken by saccharomycetes and saprophytes in fermentation,
I find, from correspondence in my possession, that in 1859 I
demonstrated to the satisfaction of Dr. Bell, F.R.S., the then head
of the chemical laboratory of Somerset House, that a very small
portion of putrefactive matter taken from an animal body, a parasitic
fungus (<i>Achorion Sch&ouml;enleinii</i>), a mould (<i>Aspergillus</i> or <i>Penicillium</i>),
and a yeast (<i>Torula cerevisi&aelig;</i>) would in a short time, and
indifferently, set up a ferment in sweet-wort and transform its
saccharine elements into alcohol, differing only in degree (quantitative),
and not in kind or quality. This, then, was the first step in
the direction towards proving symbiotic action between these several
parasitic organisms. The only apparent difference observed during
the fermentative processes was that putrefactive (saprophytic) action
commenced at a somewhat earlier stage, and that the percentage of
alcohol was also somewhat less.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>In 1856, also, the &aelig;robic bacteria attracted my attention, and,
together with the late Rev. Lord Sidney Godolphin Osborne, I exposed
plates of glass (microscopical slides), covered with glycerine and
grape sugar, in every conceivable place where we thought it possible
to arrest micro-organisms. The result is known, viz., that fungoid
bodies (moulds and bacterial) were taken in great numbers, and
varying with the seasons. The air of the hospital and sick-room
likewise engaged attention, each of which proved especially rich in
parasitic bodies. During the cholera visitation of 1858 the air
was rich in &aelig;robic and an&aelig;robic bacteria, while a <i>blue mist</i> which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
prevailed throughout the epidemic yielded a far greater number than
at any former period (represented in <a href="#pl_i">Plate I</a>., No. 13). This blue
mist attracted the especial attention of meteorologists. At a somewhat
later period a more remarkable fungoid disease, the fungus foot
of India, <i>mycetoma</i>, came under my observation, a detailed description
of which I contributed to the medical journals, and also, with
further details, to the “Monthly Microscopical Journal” of 1871.
Interlacing mycelia, ending in hyph&aelig;, in this destructive form of
parasitic disease were seen to pervade the whole of the tissues of the
foot, the bony structures being involved, and it was only possible to
stay the action of the parasite by amputation.</p>

<p>So far, then, the study of parasitic organisms had at an early
period shared largely in my microscopical work, extending over
several years, and with the result that these micro-organisms were
found to exhibit on occasions great diversity of character, and that
different members of the bacteria in particular flourish under great
diversity of action, and often under entirely opposite conditions;
that they feed upon wholly different materials, and perform an
immense variety of chemical work in the media in which they live.</p>

<p>The study of the chemistry (<i>chemotaxis</i>) of bacteria has, however,
greatly enlarged our conception of the chemical value and power of
the vegetable cell, while it is obvious that no more appropriate or
remunerative field of study could engage the attention of the
microscopist, as well as the chemist, than that of bacterial life,
and which is so well calculated to enlarge our views of created
organisms, whether belonging to the vegetable or animal kingdom.</p>

<h3>Pathogenic Fungi and Moulds.</h3>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to go back to the history of the parasitic
fungi to which diseases of various kinds were early attributable.
The rude microscopes of two and a half centuries ago revealed the
simple fact that all decomposable substances swarmed with countless
multitudes of organisms, invisible to ordinary vision. Leuwenhoek,
the father of microscopy, and whose researches were generally known
and accepted in 1675, tells of his discovery of extremely minute
organisms in rain-water, in vegetable infusions, in saliva, and in
scrapings from the teeth; further, he differentiated these living
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
organisms by their size and form, and illustrated them by means of
woodcuts; and there can be no doubt that his figures are intended
to represent leptothrix filaments, vibrios, and spirilla. In other of
his writings attempts are made to give an idea of the size of these
“animalcules”; he described them as <i>a thousand times smaller than
a grain of sand</i>. From his investigations a belief sprung up that
malaria was produced by “animalcules,” and that the plague which
visited Toulon and Marseilles in 1721 arose from a similar cause.
Somewhat later on the natural history of micro-organisms was more
diligently studied, and with increasing interest. M&uuml;ller, in 1786,
pointed out that they had been too much given to occupy themselves
in finding new organisms, he therefore devoted himself to the
study of their forms and biological characters, and it was on such
data he based a classification. Thus the scientific knowledge gained
of these minute bodies was considerably advanced, and the subject
now entered upon a new phase: the origin of micro-organisms. It
further resolved itself into two rival theories&mdash;spontaneous generation,
and development from pre-existing germs&mdash;the discussion over
which lasted more than a century. Indeed, it only ended in 1871,
when the originator of the Abiogenesis theory withdrew from the
contest, and the more scientific investigations of Pasteur (1861) found
general acceptance. This indefatigable worker had been investigating
fermentation, and studying the so-called diseases of wines and a
contagious disease which was committing ravages among silkworms.
Pasteur in time was able to confirm the belief that the “muscadine
disease” of silkworms was due to the presence of micro-organisms,
discernible only by the microscope. The oval, shining bodies in the
moth, worm, and eggs had been previously observed and described by
N&auml;geli and others, but it was reserved for Pasteur to show that when
a silkworm whose body contained these organisms was pounded up
in a mortar with water, and painted over the leaves of the tree upon
which healthy worms were fed, all took the disease and died.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">TYPICAL FORMS OF BACTERIA, SCHIZOMYCETES, OR
FISSION-FUNGI.</p></div>

<p>As the contagious particles were transmitted to the eggs, the
method adopted for preventing the spread of the disease was as
follows:&mdash;Each female moth was kept separate from the others, and
allowed to deposit her eggs, and after death her body was crushed
up in a mortar as before, and a drop of the fluid examined under the
microscope. When any trace of muscadine was found present, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
whole of the eggs and body were burnt. In this way the disease
was combated, and ultimately stamped out.</p>

<p>Pasteur also pointed out that one form or cause of disease must
not be confounded with another. For example, muscadine, a true
fungus (<i>Botrytis bassiana</i>), should not be confounded with another
disease known to attack silkworms, termed <i>pebrin</i>, this being caused
by a bacterium, and, according to the more recent researches of
Balbiani, by a Psorospermia. Botrytis is a true mould, belonging to
the Oomycetes, and allied to the potato fungus, Peronospora. It is
propagated by spores, which, falling on a silkworm, germinate
and penetrate its body. A mycelium is then developed, which
spreads throughout the body. Hyph&aelig; appear through the skin, and
bear white chalky-looking spores; these become detached, and float
in the air as an impalpable dust-like smoke. Damp further develops
the fungus.</p>

<p>Insects suffer much from the ravages of fungi. The house-fly
sticking to the window-pane is seen to be surrounded by the mycelia
of <i>Penicillium racemosum</i> (<i>Sporendonema musc&aelig;</i>, or <i>Saprolegnia fer&aelig;</i>).
In other cases Cordiceps attacks certain caterpillars belonging to the
genera Cossus and Hepialus when they are buried in the sand and
before their metamorphosis into chrysalides; they are killed by the
rapid development of hyph&aelig; and mycelium in their tissues.</p>

<p><i>Sph&aelig;ria miletaris</i>, a parasite of <i>Bombyx pilyocarpa</i>, the caterpillar
of which is found on pine-trees, is one of the few fungi which
may be regarded as beneficial to man, since it aids in the destruction
of multitudes of these caterpillars, which otherwise would devour
the young shoots and pine needles. Giard specialises other parasites
of insects, which he terms Entomophore&aelig;. Others, <i>E. rimosa</i>, attack
grasshoppers and the diptera, enveloping them in a dense coating of
mycelium and spores, which speedily kills the victim.</p>

<p>The study, then, of the life-history of germs, microbes, micro-organisms,
or bacteria (as they are indifferently termed), opened up
a new science, that of Bacteriology. By the more recent advances
in this science we are enabled to understand the very important
part these minute organisms fill in the great scheme of Nature, for
almost exclusively by their agency the soil is supplied with the
requisite nutritive material for plant life. And, as already pointed
out, wherever organic matter is present&mdash;that is, the dead and useless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
substances which are the refuse of life&mdash;such material is promptly
seized upon by micro-organisms, by means of which histolysis is
rapidly accomplished.</p>

<p>Bacteria require a power of from 600 to 1,000 diameters or more
for the determination of the species to which they belong. The
number of species has been so much increased of late that a bulky
volume is found to be insufficient for their enumeration. I am,
however, by the courtesy of Professor Crookshank, enabled to present
my readers with the typical forms of thirty-nine species of Bacteria,
Schizomycetes, or fission-fungi, a selection, it will be seen, chiefly
taken from among pathogenic organisms&mdash;those believed to originate
disease. But many of the supposed <i>Saprophytic</i> forms often described
as originating disease are merely accidental associates, that is, living
in companionship for a time.</p>

<p><i>Size.</i>&mdash;In ordinary terms of measurement, bacteria are on an average
from <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>25000</sub>th to about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>5000</sub>th of an inch long. These measurements
do not convey a definite impression to the mind. It is calculated
that a thousand million of them could be contained in a space of
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>25</sub>th of an inch. The best impression of the size of the bacteria
is, perhaps, obtained when it is stated that a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>25</sub>-inch immersion
objective gives a magnification of nearly 2,200 diameters, and that
under this power the bacteria appear to be about the size of very
small print. The standard of measurement accepted by bacteriologists
is the micro-millimeter. One millimeter is equal to about
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>25000</sub>th an English inch. The number of micrococci in a milligramme
of a culture of <i>Staphylococcus pyogenes aurens</i> has been
estimated by Bujwid by counting at eight thousand millions. Not
only do various species differ in dimensions, but considerable differences
may be noted in a pure culture of the same species. On the
other hand, there are numerous species which so closely resemble
each other in size and shape that they cannot be differentiated by
microscopic examination alone, and we have to look to other characteristics,
as colour, growth in various culture media, pathogenic power,
chemical products, &amp;c., in order to decide the question of identity.</p>

<p><i>Reproduction.</i>&mdash;The reproduction of bacteria takes place for the
most part by fission and by spore formation. <i>Fission</i> is a process
of splitting up or division, whereby an organism divides into two
or more parts, each of which lives and divides in its turn. If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
certain organisms are watched under the microscope, a coccus or
bacillus will be seen to elongate and at the same time become
narrower, until its two halves become free, the two individual
organisms again dividing and subdividing in their turn. This kind
of reproduction is more readily seen in a higher class of unicellular
organisms, the desmids. If, however, the new organisms do not
break away from each other, but remain connected in groups or
clusters, they are termed Staphylococci; if they remain connected
in the form of a chain, or like a string of beads, they are termed
Streptococci. If the division takes place in one plane, Diplococci
are formed; if in two directions Tetracocci, or Tablet-cocci, are formed.
On account of this multiplication by fission, the generic name of
Schizomycetes, or fission-fungi, has been given to bacteria.</p>

<p><i>Spores.</i>&mdash;A second method by which bacteria propagate is by
spores. These bodies are distinguished by their remarkable power
of resistance to the influence of temperature and the action of
chemical reagents. Some of them will resist their immersion in
strong acid solutions for many hours; also freezing and very
high temperatures. Spore formation may take place in two ways:
firstly, by “endogenous spores” (internal spores); secondly, by
“arthrospores.”</p>

<p><i>Endogenous Spores.</i>&mdash;When the formation of the spores takes place
in the mother-cell, the protoplasm is seen to contract, giving rise
to one or more highly refractive bodies, which are the spores. The
enclosing membrane of the organism then breaks away, leaving the
spores free.</p>

<p><i>Arthrospores.</i>&mdash;When the spore is not formed in the parent
bacillus, but when entire cells (owing to lack of favourable conditions
of growth) become converted into spores, the formation is known as
“arthrogenous,” the single individual being called an arthrospore.
When the conditions are again favourable, spores germinate, giving
rise to new bacilli. The germinating spore becomes elongated, and
loses its bright appearance, the outer membrane becomes ruptured,
and the young bacillus is set free. Certain conditions, such as the
presence of oxygen in the case of the anthrax bacillus, give rise
to the formation of spores; while various kinds of bacteria secure
continuous existence by developing spores when there is lack of
proper food material.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span></p>

<p>With reference to the incredible rapidity with which the bacteria
multiply under conditions favourable to the growth and development,
Cohn writes as follows:&mdash;“Let us assume that a microbe divides into
two within an hour, then again into eight in the third hour, and so
on. The number of microbes thus produced in twenty-four hours
would exceed sixteen and a half millions; in two days they would
increase to forty-seven trillions; and in a week the number expressing
them would be made up of fifty-one figures. At the end of twenty-four
hours the microbes descended from a single individual would
occupy <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>40</sub>th of a hollow cube, with edges <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>25</sub>th of an inch long, but at
the end of the following day would fill a space of twenty-seven cubic
inches, and in less than five days their volume would equal that of
the entire ocean.”</p>

<p>Again, Cohn estimated that a single bacillus weighs about
0·000,000,000,024,243,672 of a grain; forty thousand millions,
1 grain; 289 billions, 1 pound. After twenty-four hours the descendants
from a single bacillus would weigh <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2666</sub>th of a grain; after
two days, over a pound; after three days, sixteen and a half million
pounds, or 7,366 tons. It is quite unneccessary to state that these
figures are purely theoretical, and could only be realised if there
were no impediment to such rapid increase.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, various checks, such as lack of food and
unfavourable physical conditions, intervene to prevent unmanageable
multiplication of these bodies.</p>

<p>These figures show, however, what a tremendous vital activity
micro-organisms do possess, and it will be seen later at what great
speed they increase in water, milk, broth, and other suitable media.</p>

<p>The following bacilli, among others, have numerous flagella
distributed over the whole of the organism: the bacillus of blue
milk (<i>Bacillus cyanogenus</i>)<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>; the bacillus of malignant œdema; the
hay bacillus (<i>Bacillus subtilis</i>); <i>Proteus vulgaris</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following have only one or two flagella at the poles: the
<i>Bacillus pyocyaneus</i>, the <i>Spirillum finkleri</i>, the <i>Spirillum choler&aelig;
Asiatic&aelig;</i>, &amp;c.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span></p>

<p>The <i>Spirillum undala</i>, <i>Spirillum rubrum</i>, <i>Spirillum concentricum</i>,
and <i>Sarcin&aelig;</i>, pocket-cocci, have several flagella.</p>

<p><i>Micrococcus agilis</i> have also several flagella; these possibly arise
from one point. As I have already pointed out, the <i>classification</i>
of the bacteria is one of great difficulty, since new kinds are being
constantly discovered, and at present any attempt made in this
direction can only be considered as quite of a provisional nature.</p>

<p>The difficulties which stand in the way may be surmised from
the fact that <i>Sarcin&aelig;</i>, pocket-cocci, were originally believed to be
a single species, described by me, under the name of <i>Sarcina ventriculi</i>,
in the fourth edition of my book, “as remarkable bodies invading
the human and animal stomach, and seriously interfering with its
functions.”</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_268" src="images/fig_268.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 268.&mdash;Sarcin&aelig;.</p></div>

<p>The original woodcut of these curious parasites is reproduced in
<a href="#fig_268">Fig. 268</a>, also in <a href="#pl_ix">Plate IX</a>., No. 7, and which evidently belong to
a different species, numbering
thirty-nine altogether. Quite recently
Mr. G. H. Broadbent,
M.R.C.S., Manchester, sent me a
supply of these interesting bodies
lately discovered by him in an
infusion of cow manure. On examining
a drop with a power of
1500 diameters they were discovered moving over the field of the
microscope with a gyrating motion by the aid of flagella projecting
from each corner of the pocket. After some days, having attained
their full growth of four, eight or sixteen in a pocket, they break
up, and recommence the formative process. Sarcin&aelig; are certainly
pathogenic in their nature. Cocci in groups, or asso-cocci, are similarly
associated. These several forms of spiro-bacteria are enclosed in
a transparent cell-wall, and are sometimes described as zoogl&aelig;a.</p>

<p>Of bacteria the most characteristic groups are bacillus, bacterium,
and a species of clostridium, a bottle-shaped bacillus. It is, however,
difficult to draw a sharp line between so-called <i>species</i>.</p>

<p><i>Spiro-bacteria</i>, or <i>spirilla</i>, possess short or long filaments, rigid or
flexible, and their movements are accordingly rotatory, or in the
long axis of the filaments. These bodies are again divided into
comma bacilli, or vibrios&mdash;a name invented by the older microscopists
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
who first described them&mdash;some species of which have a flagellate
appendage, to which their movements are due.</p>

<p><b>Anthrax</b>, <b>Splenic Fever</b>, has been long known to be prevalent
among cattle at certain seasons of the year, and is believed to originate
from peculiar conditions of climate and soil. This view of splenic
fever on microscopical examination proved an entire fallacy.
Bollinger in 1872 discovered that the blood of the affected animal
was still virulent after death, owing to the presence of the <i>spores</i> of
the bacillus, and that the soil also became infected and impregnated
by the disease germs wherever the fever first broke out. In 1877
Dr. Koch made a more careful investigation into the source of the
disease, and was able to give a complete demonstration of the life-history
of the splenic fever bacillus, and to offer definite proofs
of its pathogenic properties. He pointed out that the rods grew
in the blood and tissues by lengthening and by cross division.
Further, that they not only grew into long leptothrix filaments
but they produced enormous numbers of seeds or spores. He
watched the fusion of the rods to the formation of spores and
the sprouting of fresh rods. He furthermore inoculated a mouse,
watched the effect through several generations, and fully demonstrated
that in the blood and swollen spleen of the animal the same
rods were always present. Pasteur and Paul Bret pursued the same
course of investigations, which were always followed with precisely
similar results. It was, however, principally due to the researches
of Koch that the doctrine of <i>contagium vivum</i> was placed on a
scientific basis.</p>

<p>Subsequently Koch formulated methods of cultivation, and
dictated the microscopical apparatus needful. Furthermore, he furnished
postulates for proving beyond doubt the existence of specific
pathogenic micro-organisms.</p>

<p>“The chain of evidence regarded by Dr. Koch as essential for proving
the existence of a pathogenic organism is as follows:&mdash;1. The micro-organism
must be found in the blood, lymph, or diseased tissue of man
or animal suffering from, or dead of the disease. 2. The micro-organism
must be isolated from the blood or tissue, and cultivated in suitable
media&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, outside the animal body. These pure cultivations must
be carried on through successive generations of the organism. 3. Pure
cultivation thus obtained must, when introduced into the body of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
a healthy animal, produce the disease in question. 4. In the
inoculated animal the same micro-organism must again be found.
The chain of evidence will be still more complete if, from artificial
culture, a chemical substance is obtained capable of producing the
disease quite independently of the living organism. It is not
enough to merely detect, or even artificially cultivate, a bacterium
associated with disease. An endeavour must be made to establish
the exact relationship of the bacteria to disease processes. In many
instances disease bacteria regarded as the actual contagia have been
found, on a further searching inquiry, to be entirely misleading.
It is almost needless to remind the enthusiast that the actual contagion
of the disease must be fully demonstrated.”</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 270.&mdash;Plague Bacillus, Bombay, 1897. Magnified 1200 &times;.</p></div>

<p><i>The Plague</i> (<i>Pestis Bacillus</i>).&mdash;The Bombay plague of 1897-98
will ever be remembered as one of the most appalling visitations ever
known. The number of deaths will never be accurately determined,
as the native population, among whom the disease chiefly prevailed and
became so fatal, concealed their dead or carried them away by night.
The outbreak from the first proved to be most infectious, its
incubation lasting from a few hours to a week only. It prevailed in
all the over-crowded native quarters of the city. The rats and mice
that infested the dwellings of the poor were found to be equally susceptible
with human beings, and these vermin also died by hundreds.
Those that survived left their holes and made off, in this way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
helping to spread the infective virus. On examining the bodies of
dead rats, they were found to have swollen legs, the blood being
filled by bacilli and curious monads, with whip-like appendages.
The bacillus of plague was discovered by Kitasato in 1894; it is
characterised by short rods with rounded ends, and a clear space
in the middle. The bacilli stain readily with aniline dyes, and
when cultivated on agar, white transparent colonies are formed which
present an iridescent appearance when examined by reflected light.
In addition to the bubonic swellings, the neighbouring lymphatic
glands were also swollen and blocked by bacilli.</p>

<p>My illustration (<a href="#fig_270">Fig. 270</a>) is from a micro-photograph taken in
1897, when the death rate stood very high. The general distribution
of the bacilli, together with phagocytes and the contents of
swollen lymphatic glands, magnified 1,200 &times;, is from a preparation
made in hospital. The monads from the rat’s blood, 1200 &times;, seen
threading their way among the blood corpuscles of a rat, and represented
in <a href="#fig_271">Fig. 271</a>, are somewhat larger than those found in the
Bombay rats, but the flagella in the latter were quite as marked,
while the encysted forms were wholly absent and the blood corpuscles
less crenated. The white bodies (<a href="#fig_270">Fig. 270</a>) were in some preparations,
together with the lymphatic bodies, more numerous and more swollen.</p>

<p>With regard to the conditions of life of the bacteria, they may
be divided broadly into two classes. When the organisms draw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
their nourishment from some living body or “host,” they are known
as “parasites.” These are further termed “obligate” parasites if
they exclusively live on their “host.” If the bacteria draw their
nourishment from dead organic matter, they are called “saprophytes.”
These are also divided into “obligate” and “facultative” saprophytes.
Thus it will be apparent that a parasite under certain
circumstances may readily become a saprophyte.</p>

<p>Some of the more important saprophytes are those organisms
which play an important and useful part in our every-day life, such
as, for instance, in the phenomena associated with fermentation,
and putrefaction agents which transform dead and decomposing
organic matter into their simpler elements, thus completing the
great life cycle, and rendering the dead and effete matter again
ready for the vital processes.</p>

<p>Among other life manifestations of certain bacteria may be mentioned
those which have the property of generating colouring
matter, though not chlorophyll. The bacteria themselves are
colourless and transparent, and the pigment is merely formed as a
product of their metabolism, especially under the influence of light.
Many of the bacteria give rise to various gases and odours, particularly
the an&aelig;robic organisms, which originate those foul putrefactive
gases (ammonia, sulphuretted hydrogen, &amp;c.). The blood-rain,
<i>Micrococcus prodigiosus</i>, gives off an odour resembling trimethylamin.
Micro-organisms have the property of producing various changes in
the medium on which they are grown. In many cases albuminous
bodies are peptonized and gelatine is liquefied. Many bacteria have
the faculty of resolving organic bodies into their simplest elements;
others, again, have the property of converting ammonia into nitric
and nitrous acid. Certain microbes have the property of becoming
phosphorescent in the dark. These phosphorescent bacteria are
often seen on decaying plants and wood; sometimes in tropical
climates the sea becomes luminous owing to the presence of countless
numbers of these organisms. Again, they are frequently seen on
the surface of dead fish, particularly mackerel, which often become
so bright as to strongly illuminate the cupboard in which they lie.</p>

<p>The particular class of fungi that produce disease in man and the
higher animals are generally known as “pathogenic.” These pathogenic
organisms may exert their pernicious power in several ways.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
They may be injurious on account of their abstracting nourishment
from the blood or tissues, or for the purely mechanical reason of
their stopping up the minute capillaries and blood-vessels by their
excessive multiplication. But the poisonous action of most of the
pathogenic bacteria is due to the chemical products secreted by the
organisms, and it is to the circulation and absorption within the
body of these poisons that the disturbances of the animal system,
which characterise disease, decay, and dissolution of every organism,
must be traced.</p>

<h3>Parasitic Diseases of Plants.</h3>

<p>The subject of fungoid diseases and fungus epidemics are of worldwide
interest, if only because of the annual losses to agriculturists
from parasitic diseases of plants, amounting to millions of pounds
sterling. The history of wheat-rust, and that of oats and rye, each
equally susceptible to the ravages of the same Rufus, can be traced
back to Genesis. A description of it was given in 1805 by Sir Joseph
Banks. He suggested that the germs entered the stomata, and he
warned farmers against the use of <i>rusted</i> litter, and made important
experiments on the sowing of rusted wheat-grains. A great discussion
on the barberry question followed, Fries particularly insisting
on the difference between <i>&AElig;cidium berberidis</i> and <i>Puccinia graminis</i>.
Tulasne confirmed the statement made by Henslow that the uredo
and puccinia stages belong to the same fungus, and are not mixed
species. De Bary’s investigations in 1860-64 proved that the
<i>sporidia</i> of some Uredinie&aelig; (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Coleosporium</i>) will not infect the
plant which bears the spores, and that the &aelig;cidia of certain
other forms are stages in the life-history of species of Uromyces and
Puccinia. Furthermore, De Bary in 1864 attacked the question of
wheat rust, and by means of numerous sowings of the telentospores
on barberry proved that they bring about the infection.</p>

<p>This led to the discovery of the phenomenon of <i>Heterœcism</i> (colonisation),
introducing a new idea, and clearing up many difficulties.
In 1890 the rust question entered on a new phase: it was taken up
by men of science all over the world, and active inquiries were set
on foot. The result has been the confirmation of De Bary’s results,
but with the further discovery that our four common cereals are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
attacked by no less than ten different forms of rust belonging to
five separate species or “form species,” and with several physiological
varieties, capable of turning the table upon the barberry
by infecting it. Some of these are found to be strictly confined to
one or other of the four common cereals, infecting two or more of
them, while others can infect various kinds of our common wild
grasses.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_272" src="images/fig_272.jpg" alt="" />
<p>Fig. 272.&mdash;<i>Puccinia</i>, displaying <i>uredospores</i>
and <i>telentospores</i>.</p>

<i>d.</i> <i>Triphœmium dubens</i>; <i>e.</i> Younger
spores; <i>f.</i> <i>P. lateripes</i>; magnified 450
diameters.</p></div>

<p>The fact is, that what has usually gone by the name of <i>Puccinia
graminis</i> is an aggregate of several
species, and that varietal forms of
this exist so especially adapted to
the host, that, although no morphical
differences can be detected
between them, they cannot be
transferred from one cereal to
another, pointing to physiological
variations of a kind met with
among bacteria and yeasts, but
hitherto unsuspected in these
higher parasitic fungi. It now
appears we must be prepared for
similar specialisation of varietal
forms among Ustilagine&aelig; as well
as among Uredine&aelig;.</p>

<p>Moreover, it has been found
that different sorts of wheat,
oats, barley, and rye are susceptible
to their particular rusts
in different degrees, at the bottom
of which, it is suggested, there must be some complex physiological
causes. De Bary gave proof, in 1886, that Peziza (<a href="#pl_i">Plate I</a>.,
Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6) succeeds in becoming parasitic only after <i>saprophytic</i>
culture to a strong mycelium, and that its form is altered thereby&mdash;probably
by the excretion of a poison. Professor Marshall Ward
showed that similar results took place in the case of the lily disease.
Reinhardt, in 1892, showed that the apical growth of a peziza is
disturbed and interrupted if the culture solution is employed concentrated;
and B&uuml;sgen, in 1893, showed that <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> excretes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
poison at the tips of the hyph&aelig;, thus confirming Professor Ward’s
results with the lily disease in 1888, and of later years, that a
similar excretion occurs in rust-fungus. He further found that the
water contents of the infected plant exercises an influence, as in the
case of <i>Botrytis</i> attacking chrysanthemums and other plants in
the autumn, and that cold increases the germinating capacity of the
spores.</p>

<p>Pfeiffer, in his work on “<i>Chemotaxis</i>,” shows that bacteria will
congregate in the neighbourhood of an algal cell evolving oxygen.
He also found that many motile antherozoids, zoospores, bacteria,
&amp;c., when free to move in a liquid, are attracted towards a point
whence a given chemical substance is diffusing. He was concerning
himself less with the evolution of oxygen or movements of bacteria
than with a fundamental question of stimulation to movement in
general. He found the attractive power of different chemical substances
vary with the organism, and that various other bodies beside
oxygen attract bacteria&mdash;peptone, dextrose, potassium salts, &amp;c.;
that swarm spores of the fungus <i>Saprolegnia</i> are powerfully attracted
towards the muscles of a fly’s leg placed in the water in which they
are swimming about; also, that in many cases where the hyph&aelig; of
fungi suddenly and sharply bend out of their original course to enter
the body of a plant or animal, the cause of the bending lies in
a powerful chemotropic action, due to the attraction of some substance
escaping from the body. Professor Ward has seen zoospores
of a <i>Pythium</i> suddenly dart out on to the cut surface of a bean-stem,
and there fix themselves.</p>

<p>This will be better understood by referring to the course pursued
by these bodies generally. When the spore of a parasitic fungus
settles on a plant, it frequently behaves as follows:&mdash;The spore
germinates and forms a slender tube of delicate consistency, blunt at
the end, and containing colourless protoplasm, as shown, highly
magnified in <a href="#fig_272">Fig. 272</a>, and in Figs. 273 and 274 much less magnified.
De Bary long ago showed that such a tube&mdash;the germinal-hypha&mdash;only
grows for a short time along the surface of the organ, and its
tip soon bends down and enters the plant, either through one of
the stomata or by boring its way directly through the cell-walls.
Professor Ward says these phenomena suggested to himself that the
end of the tube is attracted in some way, and by some force which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
brings its tip out of the previous direction, and De Bary has
suggested that this attraction is due to some chemical substance
excreted by the host plant. It is remarkable with what ease the
tube penetrates the cell-walls, and which Ward believes to be due to
the solvent action of an enzyme, capable of dissolving cellulose.</p>

<p>“Miyoshi carried these observations a step further when, in 1894,
he showed that if a leaf is injected with a substance such as
ammonium-chloride, dextrine, or cane-sugar (all substances capable
of exerting chemotropic attraction on fungus-hyph&aelig;), and spores of
a fungus which is <i>not parasitic</i> are then sown on it, the hyph&aelig; of
the fungus penetrate the stomata and behave exactly as if the
fungus were a true parasite.</p>

<p>“So surprising a result lets in a flood of light on many known
cases of fungi, which are, as a rule, <i>non</i>-parasitic, becoming so, in
fact, only when the host plant is in an abnormal condition, <i>e.g.</i>, the
entry of species of Botrytis into living tissues when the weather is
cold and damp and the light dull; the entry of Mucor into various
fruits, tomatoes, apples, pears, &amp;c., when the hyph&aelig; meet with
a slight crack or wound, through which the juices are exposed. It
is exceedingly probable that the rapid infection of potato leaves in
damp weather in July is traceable not merely to the favouring
effect of the moisture on the fungus, but that the state of super-saturation
of the cell-walls of the potato leaf&mdash;the tissues of which
are now unduly filled with water and dissolved sugars, &amp;c., owing to
the dull light and diminished transpiration&mdash;is the primary factor
which determines the easy victory of the parasite, and, as Professor
Ward suggested some time ago, that the suppressed life of Ustilagine&aelig;
in the stems of grasses is due to the want of particular carbo-hydrates
in the vegetative tissues, but which are present in the
grain. A year later Miyoshi carried proof to demonstration, and
showed that a fungus-hypha is actually so attracted by substances
on the other side of a membrane, and that its tip pierces the latter;
for the hyph&aelig; were made to grow through films of artificial
cellulose, of collodion, of cellulose impregnated with paraffin, of
parchment paper, and even the chitinous coat of an insect, simply
by placing the intact films on gelatine impregnated with the
attracting substance, and laying the spores on the opposite side of
the membrane.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span></p>

<p>“Now this is obviously a point of the highest importance in the
theory of parasitism and parasitic diseases, because it suggests at
once that in the varying conditions of the cells, the contents of which
are separated only by membranous walls from the fungus-hyph&aelig;,
whose entrance means ruin and destruction, there may be found
circumstances which sometimes favour and sometimes disfavour the
entrance of the hyph&aelig;; and it is, at least, a remarkable fact that
some of the substances which experiments prove to be highly attractive
to such hyph&aelig;&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, sugars, the sap of plums, phosphates,
nitrates, &amp;c.&mdash;are just the substances found in plants; and the
discovery that the action depends upon the nature of the substance
as well as on the kind of fungus, and is affected by its concentration,
the temperature, and other circumstances, only confirms us in this
idea.”</p>

<p>Moreover, there is one other fact which it is important to notice,
viz., that there are substances which repel instead of attract the
hyph&aelig;. Is it not, then, asks Professor Ward, natural to conclude
that the differences in behaviour of different parasites towards
different host-plants, and towards the same host-plant under different
conditions, probably depend on the chemotropic irritability of the
hyph&aelig; towards the substance formed in the cells on the other side
of the membranous cell-walls? And when, as often happens, the
effusion of substances, such as the cells contain, to the exterior
is facilitated by over-distension and super-saturation, or by actual
wounds, we cannot be surprised at the consequences when a fungus,
hitherto unable to enter the plant, suddenly does so. To this
proposition my answer is emphatically in the affirmative, since in
my investigations into the “fungus-foot disease” (“<i>Mycetoma</i>”),
1871, of India, the entry of the fungus was in almost every case
shown to be through an abrasion of the skin or a direct open
wound; the majority of the cases reported were among the agricultural
classes. When, then, as often happens, the effusion of
substances, such as the cells contain, to the exterior is facilitated by
over-distension and super-saturation, or by actual wounds, we cannot
be surprised at the consequences when a fungus, hitherto unable to
enter the plant, suddenly does so. Nevertheless, it must be admitted
that the knowledge gained of parasites does not satisfactorily account
for epidemic visitations over large areas.

<h3>Habitat, Specialised Forms of Parasites.</h3>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&mdash;The habitat of vegetable parasitic fungi is extremely
variable. Fungi are found everywhere, living and flourishing on
all the families of the vegetable and animal kingdoms. They attack
our houses, foods, clothes, utensils of every kind, wall papers and
books, the paste of which, to my astonishment, affords a sufficient
supply of nourishment. Members of the parasitic tribe of bacteria, by
a combined effort of countless myriads, have given rise to a sense of
supernatural agency. <i>Bacillus prodigiosus</i>, described also as <i>Palmella
mirifica</i> and <i>Zoogalactina imetropia</i>, from its attacking milk and other
alimentary substances, the spores of which are often of a deep red
colour, have been found to cover whole tracts of country in a single
night with what is called a “<i>gory dew</i>,” changing in daylight to a deep
green colour. This was at one time regarded with superstitious awe
as a miracle, as it has been known to attack bread and even the sacred
wafer, and which in medi&aelig;val ages was described as the “bleeding-host.”
This parasitic plant belongs to an&aelig;robic bacteria, and is
only developed in the dark. The nitrogen required for nutrition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
must be derived from the air. An algal form gives rise to the red
scum seen in ponds and reservoirs in the autumn. The discharge
from wounds is coloured blue by <i>Bacterium pyocyanine</i>. There are
many other forms, some of which have an orange colour, and the
genus is recognised as “<i>chromogenic microbes</i>.”</p>

<p>A cryptogam belonging to an&aelig;robic bacteria, described as <i>Protococcus
invalis</i>, on being set aside in a bottle, and a little rain water
added, was seen to
set up spontaneous
fermentation, and
in a very short time
exhibited remarkable
activity. The
colour of the infusion
changed, it
assumed a delicate
pink hue in direct
light, which deepened
to a red in reflected
light. The
fluid contents were
now observed to be
dichoric, and the
spectroscopic appearance
subsequently
presented was one of
much interest. The
spectrum was a well-marked
one, and might be taken to determine the presence of a
nitrogenous element or of glucose.</p>

<p>Among all the various plants known to suffer from the attacks of
parasites, the vine has been the greatest sufferer. The o&iuml;dium, or
<i>Erysiphe Tuckeri</i>, so called from the name of the discoverer by whom
it was first described, has been longest known to the vine grower.
This really belongs to the group Ascomycetes, and appears to have
been brought from America in 1845, whence it was passed on to
France, where it soon threatened to entirely destroy the vineyards.
This was followed by another parasite, belonging in this instance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
to the animal kingdom, <i>Phylloxera vastatrix</i>. This o&iuml;dium appears
on the grape in the form of greyish filaments, terminating in an
enlarged head, which contains an agglomeration of spores, not free
or in a chaplet, as in Aspergillus (<a href="#fig_273">Fig. 273</a>). These spores when
ripe burst from the capsule as fine dust, and are diffused by
the air in all directions, thus spreading the disease far and
away. Another of the parasitic moulds, <i>Peronospora viticola</i>, is a
kind of mildew, differing from o&iuml;dium. The hyph&aelig; penetrate
more deeply than
that of o&iuml;dium. On
the upper surface of
the leaf brown patches
appear; these branch
out and ramify as
seen in the potato-fungus,
<i>P. infestans</i>
(<a href="#fig_274">Fig. 274</a>). The
parasite destroys the
tissue of the leaf, and
it withers and dies.
There are other well-known
parasites, the
black-rot, <i>Phomauvicola</i>,
belonging to
the Ascomycetes.
This appears in early
shoots in the form
of round black spots, and gradually spreads over leaves and
young fruit. This same rot, one year, devastated the American
vineyards.</p>

<p>Cereals, wheats and grasses, suffer from other well-known forms of
microscopic fungi termed <i>rusts</i> and <i>smuts</i>, which cover the blades or
infect the full ear of the fruit. The name given indicates their
colour, and these belong, for the most part, to the genus Uredo and
the family of the Basidiomycetes. They have no endogenous spores
but as many as four forms of exogenous. This is also the case with
wheat and barley, whereby they are distinguished as <i>Uredo</i> or <i>Puccinia
graminis</i> (see Figs. 273 and 274, and <a href="#pl_i">Plate I</a>., Nos. 19 and 22,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
<i>&AElig;cidium berberidis</i>). For a long time it was believed that <i>Uredo
linearis</i> and <i>Puccinia graminis</i> were so many distinct species, but
it is now known that there are only three successive phases of the
developmental stages of a single species&mdash;that, as a matter of
fact, puccinia presents the phenomenon of alternation of generations,
that is, that the complete development of the fungus is only
effected by its transference from one plant to another. Other
uredines, Ustilago and Tilletia smuts, are more apt to affect the
ears of wheat, rye,
and other grasses
than puccinia. Bread
made from wheat
affected by smut has
an acrid and bitter
taste, while that made
from rye flour often
produces a serious
form of disease. The
propagation of either,
then, should be
stopped as quickly as
possible by destroying
all barberry bushes
growing near or
within the vicinity of
corn fields, and by
other means. The
ergot of rye is due
to distinct species of
fungi having endogenous spores enclosed in a sac or <i>ascus</i>, hence the
name of the family, Ascomycetes or <i>Tuberace&aelig;</i>, which are reproduced
by the spores contained in these asci. Truffles belong to this family.
But other members of the same family have several forms of spores,
and these again present us with the phenomenon of alternation of
generations.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p>Ergot of rye is used in medicine, but if not used with care it will
produce a dangerous disease. This parasitic fungi consists of minute
microscopic masses of spores, which cover the young flower of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
rye with a white flocculent mass, formerly termed <i>sphacelium</i>. The
mycelium formed spreads over the ear of corn in thick felt-like
masses, termed <i>sclerotis</i>. The sphacelium changes its form in the
following spring. Other changes are brought about, and it seems to
pass through a cycle of alternations of generations.</p>

<p>Bread made from rye so infested is known to produce grave
consequences, soon to become fatal if not detected in time. The
disease is termed ergotism, and gangrene of the extremities takes
place among people of the north of France and Russia, who
consume bread made from rye flour. Ergot of maize will also
cause similar diseases. Fowls and other animals fed upon this
cereal become in a short time poisoned, and the cause of death is
not rightly suspected. There is another fungus belonging to the
same group of Ascomycetes, known as <i>Eurotium repens</i>, which
appears upon leather when left in a damp place, and also upon
vegetable or animal substances if badly preserved, and gradually
destroys it. This mould is of a darkish green colour.</p>

<p>The minute spores display themselves as rows of beads when fully
ripe on the erect mycelium. <i>Aspergillus glaucus</i> represents the
white exogenous spores of the sphacelium of the ergot of rye; and
those subsequently produced in the yellow balls correspond with
the asci developed in sclerotis, the endogenous species. Many of
the parasitic species belonging to the genera <i>Erysiphe</i>, <i>Sph&aelig;ria</i>,
<i>Sordaria</i>, <i>Penicillium</i>, &amp;c., have a similar mode of propagation, and
affect a large number of plants.</p>

<h3>Parasitic Fungi of Men and Animals.</h3>

<p>In the microscopical examinations especially given to the elucidation
of parasitic diseases of the skin, previously referred to,
I discovered more varieties of spores and filaments of certain
cryptogamic plants associated with a larger number of specific forms
of fungi than any previous observer. I did not, however, feel
justified in concluding, with K&uuml;chenmeister, Schœnlein, and Robin,
that these fungoid growths were the primary cause of the diseases
referred to. Indeed, the foremost dermatologists of the period
utterly refused to entertain the specific germ theory of the German
investigators. Nevertheless, I contended, “the universality of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
distribution is in itself a fact of very considerable importance, and
one pointing to the belief that they are scavengers ever ready to
fasten on decaying matter, and, on finding a suitable soil, spread out
their invisible filaments in every direction in so persistent a manner
as to arrest growth and overwhelm the plant in destruction.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>Special forms of fungi are given in <a href="#pl_i">Plate I</a>., Nos. 10-14, and
those of the ascomycetes in Nos. 17-21.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p class="caption">Fig. 277.&mdash;Healthy fresh Yeast, from

<p><i>O&iuml;dium albicans</i> affects both animals and plants. It often attacks
the mucous membrane of the mouths of young children. The spores
become elongated and converted
into hyph&aelig;, and ramify about
in all directions, producing a
troublesome form of disease.
This parasitic fungus is better
known under another name, <i>Saccharomyces
mycoderma</i>. O&iuml;dium
resemble alg&aelig; in their mode of
life, as they are mostly found in
a liquid media. The structure
of all ferments is very simple:
each plant is composed of a
single cell, either of a spherical,
elliptical, or cylindrical form,
varying in size, and filled with
protoplasmic and nucleated matter.
This grows, and is seen to bud out and divide into two or
more parts, all resembling the mother cell.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_277">Fig. 277</a> represents the healthy cells of yeast, <i>Saccharomyces
cerevisi&aelig;</i>, freshly taken from a brewer’s vat, and in an active stage
of growth. The mode of multiplication continues as long as the
plant remains in a liquid favourable to its nutrition.</p>

<p>The changes from one stage to another are rapid, as will be
noticed on reference to the consecutive formative processes the cells
are known to pass through, <a href="#fig_278">Fig. 278</a> (1859).</p>

<p>If the development of the plant is arrested by want of a
saccharine or nitrogenous substance, and the liquid dries up, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
protoplasm contained in the cell contracts, and the spores, or
endogenous reproductive organs, of the plant will remain in a state
of rest, become perfectly dry, and yet retain life. They are not
easily killed, even when subjected to a very high or low temperature,
they do not lose the power of germination when favourable conditions
present themselves, and at once take on a new birth.</p>

<p>There are, however, many other ferments besides that of beer-yeasts,
such as alcoholic and wine ferments, the commonest of which,
according to Pasteur, is <i>Saccharomyces ellipsoideus</i>.</p>

<p>But yeast-fungi and mould-fungi, like bacteria or fission-fungi, are
micro-organisms, belonging to two specific orders, the Saccharomycetes
and the Hyphomycetes, which are intimately related to each other, but
quite distinct from bacteria. Their germs occur widely distributed in
air, soil, and water. Many species are of hygienic, while others are
of pathological interest and importance in being either accidentally
associated with, or the cause of, disease processes, while others are
fermentations of very essential service in various industrial processes.
The making of beers, wines, and spirits, as we understand them,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
constitutes but a small part of the province of fermentation. The
life activities of ferments open out a study of vast importance to
mankind, and while they have only been regarded in their worst
aspect&mdash;that of a bane&mdash;they are, nevertheless, a boon to mankind.
The first clear view we obtained of this was that of Reess, who in
1870 showed there were several species or forms of the yeast-fungus.
Hansen followed up this discovery in 1883, and, taking advantage
of the strict methods of culture introduced by bacteriologists,
found that by cultivating yeast on a solid media from a single spore
it was quite possible to obtain constant types of pure yeasts, each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
possessing its own peculiar properties. One consequence of Hansen’s
labours was that it now became possible for every brewer to work
with a yeast of uniform type instead of with haphazard mixtures, in
which serious disease forms might predominate and injure the beer.
Among other things made clear was that a true yeast may have a
mycelial stage of development. Furthermore, there is the influence
exercised by the nucleus of the yeast cell. Many other points of
interest arose out of these investigations; one was, that many higher
fungi can assume a yeast-like stage of development if submerged in
fluids, as, for instance, various species of Mucor, Ustilago, Exoascus,
and numerous others. Ascomycetes, and Basidiomycetes as well, are
known to form budding cells, and it was thought that the yeasts of
alcoholic fermentation are merely reduced forms of these higher
fungi, which have become habituated to the budding condition&mdash;a
conclusion supported by Hansen’s discovery that a true Saccharomyces
can develop a feeble, but a true, mycelium.</p>

<p>“This view has been entirely confirmed by an inquiry into the
mode of brewing <i>sak&eacute;</i> by the Japanese, by the aid of the Aspergillus
fungus. Further researches established the fact that other forms of
fungi, <i>e.g.</i>, those on the surface of fruits, developed endogenous spores,
which cause alcoholic fermentation. More recently, and by further
experimental inquiry, partly by pure cultures of separate forms,
and partly by well-devised cultures on ripening fruits still attached
to the plant but imprisoned in sterilised glass vessels, it has been
found that yeast and moulds are separate forms, not genetically
connected, but merely associated in nature, as are so many other
forms of yeasts, bacteria, and moulds. Further, Hansen has discovered
that several yeasts furnish quite distinct races or varieties
in different breweries in various parts of the world, so that we
cannot avoid the conclusion that their race characteristics have been
impressed on the cells by the continued action of the conditions of
culture to which they have so long been exposed&mdash;they are, in fact,
domesticated races.”</p>

<p>The environments of yeasts are peculiar. Sauer found that a
given variety of yeast, whose activity is normally inhibited when the
alcohol attains a certain degree of concentration in the liquid, can
be induced to go on fermenting until a higher degree is attained by
the addition of a certain lactic acid bacterium. The latter, indeed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
appears to prepare the way for the yeast. It has been shown, also,
that damage may be done to beers and wines by allowing plant
germs to gain access with the yeast; there are, too, several forms of
yeast that are inimical to the action of the required fermentation.
Other researches show that associated yeasts may ferment better
than any single yeast, and such symbiotic action of two yeasts of
high fermenting power has given better results than either alone.
English ginger-beer furnishes a curious symbiotic association of two
organisms&mdash;a true yeast and a true bacterium&mdash;so closely united
that the yeast cells become imprisoned in the gelatinous meshes of
the bacterium; and it is a curious fact that this symbiotic union of
yeast and bacterium ferments is far more energetic than either when
used alone, and the product is different, large quantities of lactic
and carbonic acids being formed, and little or no alcohol.</p>

<p>Many years ago I gave an account of similar curious symbiotic
results obtained by introducing into a wort-infusion a small proportion
of <i>German yeast</i>, an artificial product composed of honey, malt,
and a certain proportion of spontaneously-fermented wheat flour.
This, to my astonishment, produced ten per cent. more alcohol than
any of its congeners, and did not so soon exhaust itself as brewer’s
yeast.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>In the hephir used in Europe for fermenting milk, another
symbiotic association of yeast and a bacterium, it is seen that in
this process no less than four distinct organisms are concerned. I
have already instanced the fermentation of rice to produce sak&eacute;,
which is first acted upon by an Aspergillus that converts the starch
into sugar and an associated yeast, and this is also shown to
be a distinct fungus, symbiotically associated in the conversion.
“Starting, then, from the fact that the constitution of the medium
profoundly affects the physiological action of the fungus, there can
be nothing surprising in the discovery that the fungus is more active
in a medium which has been favourably altered by an associated
organism, whether the latter aids the fungus by directly altering the
medium, or by ridding it of products of excretion, or by adding
gaseous or other body. It is not difficult to see, then, that natural
selection will aid in the perpetuation of the symbiosis, and in cases
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
like that of the ginger-beer plant it is extremely difficult to get the
two organisms apart, a difficulty similar to that in the case of the
soredia of lichens.”</p>

<p>Buchner discovered that by means of extreme pressure a something
can be extracted from yeast which at once decomposes sugar
into alcohol and carbon-dioxide. This something is regarded as a
kind of incomplete protoplasm&mdash;a body, as we have already seen,
composed of proteid&mdash;and in a structural condition somewhere
between that of true soluble enzymes like invertin and a complete
living protoplasm. This reminds me of an older experiment of mine,
the immediate conversion of cane-sugar into grape-sugar. If we
take two parts of white sugar and rub it up in a mortar with one
part of a perfectly dry solid, the German yeast before spoken of, it
is immediately transformed as if by magic into a flowing liquid
mass&mdash;a syrup. This process of forming “invert sugar” can be
watched under the microscope; the liberation of carbonic acid gas
in large bubbles is seen to go on simultaneously with the assimilation
of the dextrose, and the breaking up of the crystals of sugar; the
cell at the same time increasing in size as well as in refractive power;
a curious state of activity appears to be going on in the small mass,
which is very interesting to watch throughout.</p>

<p>However, the enzymes of Buchner are probably bits off the protoplasm,
as it were, and so the essentials of the theory of fermentation
remain, the immediate agent being not that of protoplasm itself, but
of something made by or broken off from it. Enzymes, or similar
bodies, are known to be very common in plants, and the suspicion
that fungi do much work with their aid is abundantly confirmed.
It seems, indeed, that there are a whole series of these
bodies which have the power of carrying over oxygen to other bodies,
and so bringing about oxidations of a peculiar character. These
curious enzymes were first observed owing to studies on the changes
which wine and plant juice undergo when exposed to the action of
the oxygen of the air.</p>

<p>The browning of cut apples is known to be due to the action
of an oxydase, that is, an oxygen carrying ferment, and the same is
claimed for the deep colouring of certain lacs obtained from the
juice of plants, such as Anacardiace&aelig;, which are pale and transparent
when fresh drawn, but which gradually darken in colour on exposure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
to the air. Oxydases have been isolated from beets, dahlia, potato-tubers,
and several other plants. This fact explains a phenomenon
known to botanists, and partly explained by Sch&ouml;nbein as far back
as 1868, that if certain fungi (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Boletus beridies</i>) are broken or
bruised, the yellow or white flesh at once turns blue; this action is
now traced to the presence in the cell sap of an oxydase.</p>

<p>It is the diastatic activity of Aspergillus which is utilised in the
making of sak&eacute; from rice, and in the preparation of soy from the
soja bean in Japan. Katz has recently tested the diastatic activity
of Aspergillus, of Penicillium, and of <i>Bacterium megatherium</i>, in the
presence of large and small quantities of sugar, and found all are
able to produce not only diastase, but also other enzymes; as the
sugar accumulates the diastase formed diminishes, whereas the accumulation
of other carbo-hydrates produces no such effect. Harting’s
investigation on the destruction of timber by fungi derives new
interest from the discovery of an emulsion-like enzyme in many such
wood-destroying forms, which splits up glucosides, amygdalin, and
other substances into sugar, and that hyph&aelig; feed on other carbo-hydrates.
The fact, also, that Aspergillus can form inverts of the
sucrase and maltase types, as well as emulsin, inulate, and diastase,
according to circumstances of nutrition, will explain why this
fungus can grow on almost any organic substance it may happen
to alight upon. The secretion of special enzymes by fungi has a
further interest just now, for recent investigations promise to bring
us much nearer to an understanding of the phenomena of parasitism
than it was possible when I was at work upon them some forty or
fifty years ago.</p>

<p>It was De Bary who impelled botanists to abandon older methods,
and he who laid the foundation of modern mycology. Later on
he pointed out that when the infecting germinal tube of a fungus
enters a plant-cell, two phenomena must be taken into account, the
penetration of the cell-walls and tissues, and the attraction which
causes the tips of the growing hypha to face and penetrate these
obstacles, instead of gliding over them in the lines of apparent least
resistance. The further development of these two factors shows that
in the successful attack of a parasitic plant on its victim or host
these fungi can excrete cellulose-dissolving enzymes, and that they
have the power of destroying lignine. Zopf has also furnished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
examples of fungi which can consume fats. There is, however,
one other connection in which these observations on enzymes in
the plant-cell promise to be of considerable importance, viz., the
remarkable action of certain rays of the solar light on bacteria. It
has been known for some time past that if bacteria in a nutrient
liquid are exposed to sunlight they quickly die. The further
researches of Professor Marshall Ward and other workers in the
same direction have brought out the fact that it is really the light
rays, and not high temperatures, that it is especially the blue-violet
and ultra-violet rays, which exert the most effective bactericidal
action. This proof depended upon the production of actual photographs
in bacteria of the spectrum itself. Apart from this, the
Professor demonstrated that just such spores as those of anthrax, at
the same time pathogenic and highly resistant to heat, succumb
soonest to the action of these cold light-rays, and that under conditions
which preclude their being poisoned by a liquid bath. It is
in all probability the action of these rays of light upon the enzymes,
which abound in the bacterial cells, that bring about their death.</p>

<p>The sun, then, is seen to be our most powerful scavenger, and
this apparently receives confirmation in connection with Martinaud’s
observations, that the yeasts necessary for wine-making are deficient
in numbers and power on grapes exposed to intense light, and
to this is due that better results are obtained in central France as
contrasted with those in the south. “When we reflect, then, that
the nature of parasitic fungi, the actual demonstration of infection
by a fungus spore, the transmission of germs by water and air, the
meaning and significance of polymorphism, heter&aelig;cism, symbiosis,
had already been rendered clear in the case of fungi, and that it was
by these studies in fermentation, and in the life-history of the fungus
Saccharomyces, that the way was prepared for the &aelig;tiology of bacterial
diseases in animals, there should be no doubt as to the mutual
bearings of these matters.”</p>

<h3>Industrial uses of Fungi and Saccharomycetes.</h3>

<p>There are many industrial processes which are more or less
dependent for success on bacterial fermentations. The subject is
young, but the results already obtained are seen to be of immense
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
importance from a scientific point of view, and to open up vistas of
practical application already being taken advantage of in commerce,
while problems are continually being raised by the forester, the
agriculturist, the gardener, the dairyman, the brewer, dyer, tanner,
and with regard to various industries, which will eventually confer
great advantages in their economic application.</p>

<p>The remarkable discovery made by Alvarez of the bacillus,
which converts a sterilised decoction of the indigo plant into indigo
sugar and indigo white, the latter then oxidising to form the
valuable blue dye, whereas the sterile decoction itself, even in
presence of oxygen, forms no indigo, plainly proves how these
minute organisms may be turned to a good account. There are,
however, important points to be determined as to the action of the
fermentation brought about by these enzymes, and the appearance of
certain mysterious diseases in the indigo vats. Again, certain stages
in the preparation of tea and tobacco leaves are found to depend
upon very carefully regulated fermentations, which must be stopped
at the right moment, or the product will be spoilt. Regarding the
possible <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of bacteria, the West Indian tobacco has a special
bacterium, which has been isolated and found to play a very important
part in its flavour. Every botanist knows that flax and hemp are the
best fibres of Linum and Cannabis respectively, separated by steeping
in water until the middle lamella is destroyed and the fibres isolated;
but it is not so well known that <i>not every water</i> is suitable for this
“retting” or steeping process; and for a long time this was as much
a mystery as why some waters are so much better than others for
brewing. Quite recently Fribes has succeeded in isolating the bacillus
upon which the dissolution of the middle lamella depends. This
investigation brought out other interesting details as to the reaction
produced by living micro-organisms, and which can be utilised in
deciding questions of plant chemistry too subtile for testing with
ordinary re-agents. One other important fact connected with these
researches is that botanists have now discarded the view that the
middle lamella of the plants referred to is composed of cellulose,
and know that it consists of pectin compounds. Fribes’ an&aelig;robic
bacillus is found to dissolve and destroy pectins and pectinates, but
does not touch cellulose or gum. It is well known that the steeping
of skins in water in preparation for tanning involves bacterial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
action, owing to which the hair and epidermal coverings are removed,
but it also appears that in the process of swelling the limed
skins, the gases evolved in the substance of the tissues, and the evolution
of which causes the swelling and loosens the fibre so that the
tanning solutions may penetrate, are due to a particular fermentation
caused by a bacterium, which, according to some investigators, is
identical with a lactic ferment introduced by the pine bark, and
which is responsible for the advantageous acidification of the tanning
solutions.</p>

<p>Hay is made in different ways, and in those where a “spontaneous”
heating process is resorted to the fermentation is no doubt dependent
upon the presence of thermogenic bacteria. But probably no other
subject has attained to so much importance as the bacteriology
of the dairy: the study of the bacteria found in milk, butter, and
cheese in their various forms.</p>

<p>Of milk, especially, much has been written and said as a
disease-transmitting medium, and with every good reason, and, if
the statement of a Continental authority may be accepted that
each time we eat a slice of bread and butter we devour a number
of bacteria equal to the population of Europe, we have sure
grounds for seeking for further information as to what these
bacteria are and what they are doing. And similarly so with
cheese, which teems with millions of these minute organisms.</p>

<p>“Some few years ago it was found that the peculiar aroma of
butter was due to a bacterium. There are two species of bacteria,
one of which develops an exquisite flavour and aroma, but the
butter keeps badly, while the other develops less aroma, but the
butter keeps better. In America, however, they have isolated and
distributed pure cultures of a particular butter bacillus which
develops the famous ‘June’ flavour, hitherto only met with in the
butter made in a certain district during a short season of the year.
This fine-flavoured butter is now constantly manufactured in a
hundred American dairies; and the manufacture of pure butter
with a constant flavour has become a matter of certainty.</p>

<p>“Properly considered, the manufacture of cheese is a form of
‘microscopic gardening’ even more complex and more horticultural
in nature than the brewing of beer. From the first moment, when
the cheesemaker guards and cools his milk, till his stock is ready
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
he is doing his best to keep down the growth of micro-organisms
rushing about to take possession of his milk. He therefore coagulates
it with rennet&mdash;an enzyme of animals, but also, as we have
seen, common in plants&mdash;and the curd thus prepared is simply
treated as a medium, on which he grows certain fungi and bacteria,
with every needed precaution for favouring their development, and
protecting them against the inroads of other pests and against
unsuitable temperature, moisture, and access of light. Having
succeeded in growing the right kind of plants on his curd, his art
then demands that he shall stop their growth at the critical
moment, and his cheese is ready for market.</p>

<p>“Furthermore, the particular flavour and peculiar odours of cheeses,
as Camembert, Stilton, and Roquefort, have to be obtained, and this
is secured, for instance, by cultivating a certain fungus, Penicillium,
on bread, and purposely adding it to Roquefort. This is found to
destroy the lactic and other acids, and so enables certain bacteria
in the cheese to set to work and further change the medium;
whereas in another kind of cheese the object is to prevent this
fungus paving the way for these bacteria. Another kind of bacillus
has been discovered which gives a peculiar clover aroma to certain
cheeses.</p>

<p>“It is thought that more definite results will be obtained by
the investigation of the manufacture of the vegetable cheeses of
China and Japan, which are made by exposing the beans of the
leguminous plant, <i>Glycine</i>&mdash;termed soja-beans&mdash;to bacterial fermentations
in warm cellars with or without certain mould-fungi.
Several kinds of bean-cheeses are made in this way, known by
special names. They all depend upon the peculiar decompositions
of the tissues of the cotyledons of the soja-beans, which contain
35 to 40 per cent. of proteids and quantities of fatty matter. The
softened beans are first rendered mouldy, and the interpenetrating
hyph&aelig; render the contents accessible to certain bacteria, which
peptonise and otherwise alter them. There is the further question
of the manufacture of vinegar by fermentation, of the preparation
of soy from a brine extract of mouldy and fermented soja-beans, of
bread-making, and other equally interesting manufactures.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span></p>

<h3>Results of De Bary’s Investigations in Parasitism.</h3>

<p>“When the idea of parasitism was rendered definite by the fundamental
distinction drawn by De Bary between a <i>parasite</i> and a
<i>saprophyte</i>, it soon became evident that some further distinction
must be made between <i>obligate facultative</i> parasites and saprophytes
respectively. De Bary, when he proposed these terms for adoption,
was clearly alive to the existence of transitions which we now
know to be numerous and so gradual in character that we can no
longer define any such physiological groups. Twenty years ago
penicillium and mucor would have been regarded as <i>saprophytes</i>
of the most obligate type, but we now know that under certain
circumstances these fungi can become parasites, and the borderland
between facultative parasites and saprophytes on the one hand, and
between the former and true parasites on the other, can no longer
be recognised.”</p>

<p>In 1866 the germ of an idea was sown which has taken root and
extended. De Bary pointed out that in the case of lichens we have
either a fungus parasite on an alg&aelig;, or else certain organisms hitherto
accepted as alg&aelig; are merely incomplete forms.</p>

<p>“In 1879 the same observer definitely launched the new hypothesis
of <i>symbiosis</i>. The word itself is due to Frank, who, in a
valuable paper on the biology of the thallus of certain lichens,
very clearly set forth the existence of various stages of life in
common among all the lower forms of plants. The details of these
matters are now principally of historical interest. We now know
that lichens are dual organisms, composed of various alg&aelig;,
symbiotic with Ascomycetes, with Basidiomycetes, and, as Massee
has shown, even with Gastromycetes. The soil contains also
bacterio-lichens. Hence arose a new biological idea&mdash;that a fungus
may be in such nicely-balanced relationship with the host from
which it derives its sustenance, that it may be attended with nearly
equal advantage to both.</p>

<p>“In the humus of forests we find the roots of beeches and other
Cupulifer&aelig; (willows, pines, and so forth) clothed with a dense mantle
of hyph&aelig;, and swollen into fleshlike masses of mycorhiza. In
similar soils, and in moorlands, which abound in the slowly decomposing
root-fibres and other vegetable remains so characteristic of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
these soils, the roots of orchids, heaths, gentians, &amp;c., are similarly
provided with fungi, the hyph&aelig; of which penetrate further into the
tissues, and even send haustoria into the living cells, but without
injuring them. As observations multiplied it became clear that the
mycorhiza, or fungus-root, was not to be dismissed as a mere case
of roots affected by parasites, but that a symbiotic union, comparable
to that of the lichens, exists, and we must assume that both
tree and fungus derive benefit from the connection.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_280" src="images/fig_280.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 280.&mdash;Fine Section through Truffle.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Asci filled with spores; <i>b.</i> Mycelia, &times; 250.</p></div>

<p>“Frank stated, as the result of his experimental research, that
seedling forest-trees cannot be grown in sterilised soil, where their
roots are prevented from forming mycorhiza; and he concluded
that the fungus conveys organic materials to the roots, which it
obtains by breaking down the leaf-mould and decaying plant
remains, together with water and minerals from the soil, and plays
the especial part of a nitrogen-catching apparatus. In return for
this import service the root pays a tax to the fungus by sparing
it certain of its tissue contents. It is a curious fact then that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
the mycorhiza is only formed where humus or vegetable mould
abounds.”</p>

<p>These instructive investigations offer an intelligible explanation
of the growth of that well-known subterranean fungus, the truffle
(<i>Tuber cibarium</i>), the microscopic appearances of a section of which
formed the subject of a paper I contributed to “The Popular
Science Review” some years ago (1862). The fungus, as will be
seen by the fine section cut through a truffle, <a href="#fig_280">Fig. 280</a>, consists of
flocculent filaments, which in the first instance cover the ground
at the fall of the leaf in autumn, under oak or beech trees, the
hyph&aelig; of which penetrate the ground, through the humid soil to the
<i>root-hairs</i> of the tree. Filaments (mycelia) are again given off which
terminate in asci or sacs filled with minute spores of about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2500</sub>th
of an inch in size, while the interspaces are filled up by mycelia,
that become consolidated into a firm nut-like body.</p>

<p>What happens, then, is this: Trees and plants with normal roots
and root-hairs, when growing in ordinary soil, can adapt their roots
to life in a soil heavily charged with humus only by contracting
symbiotic association with the fungus and paying the tax demanded
by the latter in return for its supplies and services. If this
adaptation is impossible, and no other suitable variation is evolved,
such trees cannot grow in such soils. The physiological relations
of the root to the fungus must be different in details in the case
of non-green, purely saprophytic, plants, Neottia, Monotropa, &amp;c.,
and in that of green plants like Erica, Fagus, and Pinus. It is,
however, a well-known fact that ordinary green plants cannot
utilize vegetable d&eacute;bris directly, and forest trees do so in appearance
only, for the fungi, yeasts and bacteria there are actively decomposing
the leaves and other remains. A class of pseudo-symbiotic
organisms are, however, being brought into the foreground, where
the combined action of two symbionts results in the death of or
injury to a third plant, each symbiont alone proving harmless.
Some time ago Vuillemin showed that a disease in olives results from
the invasion of a bacillus (<i>B. ole&aelig;</i>), which can, however, only obtain
its way into the tissues through the passages driven by the hyph&aelig;
of a fungus (Ch&aelig;tophoma). The resulting injury is a sort of burr.
This observer also observed the same bacillus and fungus in the
canker burrs of the ash.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span></p>

<p>Among many similar cases well worth further attention are the
invasion of potato-tubers by bacteria, these making their way down
the decaying hyph&aelig; of pioneer fungi. Professor Marshall Ward has
seen tomatoes infected by similar means, and other facts show that
many bacteria which quicken the rotting of wood are thus led into
the tissues by fungi.</p>

<p>Probably no subject in the whole domain of cryptogamic botany
has wider bearings on agricultural science than the study of the
flora and changes on and in manure and soil. Nitrifying bacteria
play a very important part by providing plant life with a most
necessary food. They occur in the soil, and two kinds have been
described&mdash;the one kind converting ammonia into nitrous acid, and
the other changing nitrous into nitric acid. We are principally
indebted to Winogradsky for our knowledge of these bacteria;
he furnishes instances of the bearing of bacteriological work on
this department of science, and explains, not only the origin
of nitre-beds and deposits, but also the way the ammonia compounds
fixed by the soil in the neighbourhood of the root-hairs
are nitrified, and so rendered directly available to plant life.
The investigations of other observers show that the nitrifying
organism is a much more highly-developed and complex form than
had been suspected; that it can be grown on various media, and that
it exhibits considerable polymorphism&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, it can be made to branch
out and show other characteristics of a true fungus. “I have,”
writes Professor Ward, “for some time insisted on the fact that
river water contains reduced forms of bacteria&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, forms so altered
by exposure to light, changes of temperature, and the low nutritive
value of the water, that it is only after prolonged culture in richer
food media that their true nature becomes apparent.” Strutzer
and Hartleb show that the morphological form of the nitrifying
organism can be profoundly altered by just such variations of the
conditions described by Ward, and that it occurs as a branched
mycelial form; as bacilli or bacteria; or as cocci of various dimensions,
according to the conditions.</p>

<p>“These observations, and others made on variations in form
(polymorphism) in other fungi and bacteria, open out a vast field
for further work, and must lead to advancement in our knowledge
of these puzzling organisms; they also help us to explain many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
inconsistencies in the existing systems of classification of the so-called
‘species’ of bacteria as determined by test-tube culture.”</p>

<p><b>Alg&aelig;.</b>&mdash;The algals have a special charm for microscopists. I am
free to confess my interest in these organisms, and for several reasons.
In this humid climate of ours they are accessible during the greater
part of the year; they can be found in any damp soil, in bog, moss,
and in water&mdash;indeed, wherever the conditions for their existence
seem to be at all favourable for development. Should the soil dry
up for a time, when the rain returns alg&aelig; are seen to spring into
life and give forth their dormant spores, which once more resume the
circle of formation and propagation. In the earliest stage of development
the spore or spore cell is so very small when in a desiccated
state, that any number may be carried about by the slightest breath
of air and borne away to a great distance. To all such organisms I
originally gave the name of &AElig;rozoa; now recognised as &aelig;robic and
an&aelig;robic organisms (<a href="#fig_281">Fig. 281</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_281" src="images/fig_281.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 281.&mdash;&AElig;robic Spores &times; 200.</p>

<p>1. &AElig;robic fungi caught over a sewer; 2. Fragments of Penicillium spores;
3. &AElig;robic fungi taken in the time of the cholera visitation, 1854.</p></div>

<p>With reference to the &aelig;robic bacteria I have only to add that
in addition to the simple mode of taking them on glass slides smeared
over with glycerine, special forms of &aelig;roscopes are now in use for the
purpose, consisting of a small cylinder in which a current of air is
produced by an aspirator and diffused through a glass vessel containing
a sterilised fluid. These are in constant use in all bacteriological
laboratories. The results obtained are transferred to sterilised
flasks or tubes as those shown in a former chapter.</p>

<p>Miquel, who has given considerable attention to the subject of
&aelig;robic and an&aelig;robic bacteria, reckons that the number of spores that
find their way into the human system by respiration, even should
health be perfectly sound, may be estimated at 300,000 a day.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span></p>

<p>One of the most commonly met with forms of micro-organisms is
<i>Leptothrix buccalis</i>. It chiefly finds its nutritive material in the
interstices of the teeth, and is composed of short rods and tufted
stems of vigorous growth, to which the name of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>
has been given (<a href="#fig_282">Fig. 282</a>). Among numerous other fungoid bodies
discovered in the mouth, Sarcin&aelig; have been found. See <a href="#pl_ix">Plate IX</a>.,
No. 7.</p>

<p>The Beggiatoa, a sewage fungus, found by me in the river Lea
water of 1884 growing in great profusion, consists chiefly of
mycelial threads and a number of globular, highly refractive bodies,
and may be regarded as evidence of the presence in the water of an
abnormal amount of sulphates which set free a gas, sulphuretted
hydrogen, of a dangerous and offensive character. Another curious
body closely allied to <i>Beggiatoa alba</i> is Cladothrix; this assumes
a whitish pellicle on the surface of putrefying liquids.</p>

<p>These saprophytes obtain nourishment from organic matter;
nevertheless they are not true parasites in the first stage of their
existence, during which they live freely in the water or in damp
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
soil; they, however, become pathogenic parasites when they penetrate
into the tissues of animals, and necessarily live at the expense
of their host.</p>

<p>Bacteria, as I have said, were for a long time classed with fungi
under the name of Schizomycetes. But the more recent researches
into their organisation, and more especially into their mode of reproduction,
show that they rather more resemble a group of alg&aelig; devoid
of chlorophyll. Zopf asserts that the same species of algals may at
one time be presented in the form of a plant living freely in water,
or in damp ground, in association with chlorophyllaceous protoplasm,
and at another in the form of a bacterium devoid of green colouring
matter, and receiving nourishment from organic substances previously
elaborated by plants or animals, thus accommodating itself, according
to circumstances, to two very different modes of existence.</p>

<p>That widely-distributed single-cell plant, the <i>Palmoglœa macrococca</i>
of K&uuml;tzing, that spreads itself as a green slime over damp stones,
walls, and other bodies, affords an example. If a small portion be
scraped off and placed on a slip of glass, and examined with a
half or a quarter-inch power, it will be seen to consist of a number
of ovoid cells, having a transparent structureless envelope, nearly
filled by granular matter of a greenish colour. At certain periods
this mass divides into two parts, and ultimately the cell becomes
two. Sometimes the cells are united end to end, just as we see them
united in the actively-growing yeast plant; but in this case the
growth is accelerated, apparently, by cold and damp. Another
plant belonging to the same species, the <i>Protococcus pluvialis</i>, is
found in every pool of water, the spores of which must be always
floating in the air, since they appear after every shower of rain.</p>

<p><i>Protococcus pluvialis</i> is furnished with motile organs&mdash;two or
more vibratile flagella passing through perforations in the cell-wall&mdash;whereby,
at certain stages, they move rapidly about. The
flagella are distinctly seen on the application of the smallest drop
of iodine. The more remarkable of the several forms presented by
the plant is that of naked spores, termed by Flotow <i>H&aelig;matococcus
porphyrocephalus</i>. These minute bodies are usually seen to consist
of green, red, and colourless granules in equal proportions, and
occupying different portions of the cell. They seem to have some
share in the after subdivision of the cell (<a href="#fig_283">Fig. 283</a>). There are also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
<i>still</i>-cells, which sub-divide into two, while the motile cells divide
into four or eight. It is not quite clear what becomes of the motile
zoospores, <small>B</small>, but as they have been seen to become encysted, they
doubtless have a special function, or become <i>still</i>-cells under certain
circumstances.</p>

<p>It appears that both longitudinal and transverse division of the
primordial cell takes place; and that the vibratile flagella of the
parent cell retain to the last their function and their motion after
the primordial cell has become detached and transformed into an
independent secondary cell (<a href="#fig_283">Fig. 283</a>, <small>G</small>).</p>

<p>The most striking of the vital phenomena presented by Protococcus
is that of periodicity. Certain forms&mdash;for instance, encysted
zoospores, of a certain colour, appear in a given infusion, at first
exclusively, then they gradually diminish, become more and more
rare, and finally disappear altogether. After some time their number
again increases, and this may be repeated. Thus, a cell which at
one time presented only still forms at another contained only motile
ones. The same may be said with respect to segmentation. If
a number of motile cells be transferred from a larger vessel into a
smaller one, in the course of a few hours most of them will have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
subsided to the bottom, and in the course of the day observed to be
on the point of sub-division. On the following morning division
will have become completed; on the next day the bottom of the
vessel will be found covered with a new generation of self-dividing
cells, which, again, will produce another generation. This regularity,
however, is not always observed. The influence of every change in
the external conditions of life upon the plant is very remarkable.
It is only necessary to pour water from a smaller into a larger or
shallower vessel to at once induce segmentation of cells. The same
phenomenon occurs in other algals; thus Vaucheria almost always
develops zoospores at whatever time of year they may be brought
from their natural habitat into a warm room. Light is conducive to
the manifestation of vital action in the motile spores; they usually
collect in great numbers on the surface of the water, and at that
part exposed to the strongest light.</p>

<p>But in the act of propagation, on the contrary, and when about to
pass into the still condition, the motile Protococcus cell seems to shun
light, and falls to the bottom of the vessel. Too strong sunlight,
as when concentrated by a lens, quickly kills the young zoospores.
A temperature of undue elevation is injurious to the development
of their vital activity and the formation of the zoospores. Frost
destroys motile, but not still zoospores.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p><i>Stephanosph&aelig;ra pluvialis</i> is a conspicuous variety of the fresh-water
algals, described by Cohn. It consists of a cell containing
eight primordial cells filled with chlorophyll, uniformly arranged
(see <a href="#pl_i">Plate I</a>., No. 24 <i>d</i>). The globular mother-cell rotates, somewhat
in the same way as the volvox, by vibratile flagella, two of which are
seen projecting from each cell and piercing the transparent outer
cell wall. Every cell divides first into two, then four, and lastly
eight cells, each one of which again divides into a number of micro-gonidia,
which have a motion within the mother-cell, and ultimately
escape from it. Under certain circumstances each of the eight
young cells is observed to change places in the interior of the cell;
eventually they escape, lose their flagella, form a thicker membrane
as at <i>b</i>, and for a time remain motionless, and sink to the bottom
of the vessel in which they are contained. If the vessel is permitted
to become thoroughly dry, and then again has water poured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
into it, motile cells reappear; from which circumstance it is probable
that these represent the resting spores of the plant. When in the
condition of greatest activity its division into eight is perfected
during the night, and early in the morning light the young cells
escape and pass through similar changes. It is calculated that in
eight days, under favourable circumstances, 16,777,216 families
may be formed from one resting-cell of Stephanosph&aelig;ra. In certain
of the cells, and at particular periods, remarkable amœboid bodies
(<a href="#pl_i">Plate I</a>., No. 24 <i>c</i>) make their appearance. There is a marked
difference between Stephanosph&aelig;ra and Chlamydococcus, for while in
the latter the individual portions of a primordial cell separate entirely
from one another, each developing its own enveloping membrane,
and ultimately escaping as a unicellular individual; in the former,
on the other hand, the eight portions remain for a time living in
companionship.</p>

<p><i>Volvocine&aelig;.</i>&mdash;A fresh-water unicellular plant of singular beauty
and interest to the microscopist is the <i>Volvox globator</i> (<a href="#pl_i">Plate I</a>.,
No. 15). No. 16 represents a portion of another cell, with
brownish amœboid bodies enclosed in the protoplasmic web. It is
common to our fresh-water pools, and attains a diameter of about
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>20</sub>th or <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>30</sub>th of an inch. Its movement is peculiar, a continued roll
onwards, or a rotation like that of a top; at other times it glides
along smoothly. When examined under a sufficiently high power, it
is seen to be a hollow sphere, studded with green spots, and traversed
by green threads connecting each of the spots or spores with the
maternal cell. From each of the spores proceed two long flagella,
lashing filaments, which keep the globular body on the move. After
a time the sphere bursts, and the contained sporules issue forth and
speedily pass through a similar stage of development. These interesting
cells were long taken to be animal bodies. Ehrenberg
described them as <i>Monads</i>, possessing a mouth, stomach, and an
eye.</p>

<p>The setting free of the young volvox is essentially a process of
cell division, occurring during the warmer periods of the year,
and, as Professor Cohn shows, is a considerable advance upon the
simpler conjugation of two smaller cells in desmids; it more closely
resembles that which prevails among the higher alg&aelig; and a large
number of cryptogams. As autumn advances the volvox spherules
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
usually cease to multiply by the formation of zoosporanges, and
certain of their ordinary cells begin to undergo changes by which
they are converted, some into male or sperm-cells, others into
germ-cells, but the greater number appear to remain sterile. Both
kinds of cells at first so nearly resemble each other that it is only
when the sperm cells begin to undergo sub-division that they are
seen to be about three times the size of the sterile cells. Then the
primary cell resolves itself into a cluster of peculiar secondary cells,
each consisting of an elongated body containing an orange-coloured
endochrome and a pair of long flagella, as seen in the antherozoids of
the higher cryptogams. As the sperm-cells approach maturity the
clusters may be seen to move within them; the bundles then
separate and show an independent active movement while still
within the cavity of the primary cell, and finally escape through
a rupture in the cell-wall, rapidly diffusing themselves as they pass
through the cavity. The germ-cells continue to increase in size
without undergoing sub-division, at first showing large vacuoles in
their protoplasm, but subsequently becoming filled with a darker
coloured endochrome. The form of the cell also changes from its
flask-like shape to the globular, and at the same time seems to
acquire a firmer envelope. Over this the swarming antherozoids
diffuse themselves and penetrate the substance to the interior, and
are then lost to view. The product of this fusion, Cohn tells us, is
a reproductive cell, or “oospore,” which speedily becomes enveloped
in another membrane with a thicker external coat, beset with conical-pointed
processes; and now the chlorophyll of the young cell gives
place, as in Palmogl&aelig;, to starch and reddish or orange-coloured, and
a more highly refractive, fluid. As many as forty of such oospores
have been counted in a single sphere of volvox, which then acquires
the peculiar appearance observed by Ehrenberg, and described by
him under the name of <i>Volvox stellatus</i>. The further history of
this wonderful spheroid unicellular plant has been traced out by
Kirchner, who found that their germination commences in the early
months of the year&mdash;in February&mdash;with the liberation of the spherical
endospore from its envelope and its division into four cells. A
remarkable phenomenon has been observed by Dr. Braxton Hicks&mdash;the
conversion of an ordinary volvox cell into a moving mass of
protoplasm that bears a striking resemblance to the well-known
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
amœba. “Towards the end of the autumn the endochrome mass of
the volvox increases to nearly double its ordinary size, but instead
of undergoing the usual sub-division so as to produce a macrogonidium,
it loses its colour and regularity of form, and becomes an
irregular mass of colourless protoplasm, containing a number of
brownish granules.” The final change and the ultimate destination of
these curious amœboid bodies have not been satisfactorily made out,
but from other observations on the protoplasmic contents of the
cells of the roots of mosses, which in the course of two hours become
changed into ciliated bodies, it is believed that this is the mode
in which these fragile structures are enabled to retain life and to
resist all the external conditions, such as damp, dryness, and the
alternations of heat and cold.</p>

<p>It would be quite impossible to deny the great similarity there is
between the structure of volvox and that of the motile cell of
<i>Protococcus pluvialis</i>. The influence of reagents will sometimes
cause the connecting processes of the young cells, as in Protococcus,
to be drawn back into the central mass, and the connecting threads
are sometimes seen as double lines, or tubular prolongations of the
membrane. At other times they appear to be connected by star-like
prolongations to the parent cell (<a href="#pl_i">Plate I</a>., No. 15), presenting
an almost identical appearance with <i>Pediastrum pertusum</i>. Another
body designated by Ehrenberg <i>Sph&aelig;rosira volvox</i> is an ordinary
volvox in a different stage of development; its only features of dissimilarity
being that a large proportion of the green cells, instead of
being single, are double or quadruple, and that the groups of flagellate
cells form by their aggregation discoid bodies, each furnished with
a single flagellum. These clusters separate themselves from the
parent cell, and swim off freely under the forms which have been
designated Uvella and Syncrypta by Ehrenberg. Mr. Henry Carter,
F.R.S., who made a careful investigation of unicellular plants,
described Sph&aelig;rosira as the male, or spermatic form of <i>volvox</i>.</p>

<p>Among other organisms closely allied to volvox and included in
Volvocine&aelig;, affording the microscopist many interesting transitional
forms in their various modes of fructification, are the Eudorina,
still-water organisms that pass through a similar process of reproduction
as the volvox. In the <i>Pandorina morum</i>, its reproduction is
curiously intermediate between the lower and the higher types; as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
within each cell is a mulberry-like mass, composed of cells possessing
a definite number of swarm spores, sixteen usually, which rupture
the mother cell, and swim off furnished with a pair of flagella. A
similar process takes place in some of the Confervace&aelig; and other fresh-water
alg&aelig;. The Palmella, again, consist of (<a href="#pl_i">Plate I</a>., No. 21) minute
organisms of very simple structure, which grow either on damp
surfaces or in fresh water. The stonework of some of our churches
is often seen to be covered with a species of Palmella, that take the
form of an indefinite slimy film. The “red snow” of Arctic or
Alpine regions, considered to be a species of Protococcus, is frequently
placed among Palmella. A more characteristic form of the
<i>P. cruenta</i> is the <i>H&aelig;matococcus sanguinis</i>, the whole mass of which
is sub-divided by partitions enclosing a larger or smaller number of
cells, which diffuse their granular contents through the gelatinous
mass in which their several changes take place. The albuminoid
envelope of these masses is seen to contain parasitic growths,
which have given rise to some discussion, especially when their
filaments are observed to radiate in various directions.</p>

<p>The <i>Oscillariace&aelig;</i> constitute a genus of Confervace&aelig; which have
always had very great interest for the microscopist in consequence
of their very remarkable animal-like movements, and from which
they derive their generic name. For more than a century these
Bacillaria have excited the curiosity of all observers without any one
having derived more than an approximate idea of their remarkable
rhythmical movements. The frustule consists of a number of very
fine short threads attached together by a gelatinous sheath, in one
species all of equal length. Their backward and forward movement
is of a most singular character; the only other conferva in which
I have seen a motion of a similar kind is the Schizonema. In this
species the frustules are packed together in regular series, the front
and side views being always in the same direction. These several
bodies move along within the filamentous sheath without leaving
their respective places. On carefully following the movement, it is
seen at first much extended, and then more compressed, while the
frustules become more linear in their arrangement, and present
a closer resemblance to <i>Bacillaria paradoxa</i>, augmented by the
circumstance that the frustules are seen to move in both directions.
A frustule of Schizonema can move independently of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
sheath, and so will a detached frustule of bacillaria. This peculiar
and exceptionally anomalous phenomenon as that of the movements
of bacillaria can hardly be confined to a solitary species.
The movements of the frustules are much accelerated by warmth
and light. The longer filaments of other minute species only
slightly exhibit any
motion of the kind,
but have peculiar
undulating motions.</p>

<p>Confervace&aelig; are a
genus of algals. The
species consist of unbranched
filaments
composed of cylindrical
or moniliform cells,
with starch granules.
Many are vesicular,
and all multiply by
zoospores generated in
the interior of the
plant at the expense
of the granular matter.
They are, for the most
part, found in fresh
water attached or
floating, some in salt
water, and a few in
both, in colour usually
green, but occasionally
olive, violet, and red.
The Confervace&aelig; proper
are often divided
into four families: 1. <i>Hydrodictid&aelig;</i>; 2. <i>Zygnemid&aelig;</i>; 3. <i>Confervid&aelig;</i>;
4. <i>Ch&aelig;tophorid&aelig;</i>. To the microscopist all the plants of this genera
are extremely interesting as subjects for the study of cell multiplication.
The process usually takes place in the terminal cell, the
first step in which is the division of the endochrome, and then
follows a sort of hour-glass contraction across the cavity of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
parent cell, whereby it is divided into two equal parts. This is
better seen in some of the desmids than in <a href="#fig_284">Fig. 284</a>, Nos. 4, 5, and 6.
Some species are characterised by a different mode of reproduction;
these possess a number of nuclei, and multiply by zoospores of two
kinds, the largest of which have either two or four cilia, which
germinate directly the smaller are biciliated; conjugation has been
seen to take place in a few instances.</p>

<p>Allied to the Confervace&aelig; is an interesting plant, <i>Sph&aelig;roplea
annulina</i>, which has received careful attention from Cohn. The
oospores of this plant are the product of a process partaking of
a sexual nature, and when mature are filled with reddish fat
vesicles which divide by segmentation.</p>

<p>The <i>&AElig;dogoniace&aelig;</i> also closely resemble Confervace&aelig; in habits of
life, but differ in some particulars, especially so in the mode
of reproduction (only a single large zoospore being set free from
each cell) and by the almost complete fission of the cell-wall or one
of the rings which serve as a hinge. The zoospores are the largest
known among algals, and each is described as having a red
eye-spot. The <i>Ch&aelig;tophorace&aelig;</i> form an interesting group of confervoid
plants, and are usually found in running streams, as they
prefer pure water. One of the characteristics of the group is that
the extremities of the branches are prolonged into an acute-shaped
termination, as represented in <a href="#fig_284">Fig. 284</a>, No. 6. A very pretty object
under the microscope is <i>Draparnaldia glomerata</i>, belonging to this
species. It consists of an axis composed of a row of cells, and
at regular intervals whorls of slender prolongations, containing
chlorophyll or endochrome of a deeper green; these attain to an
extraordinary length.</p>

<p>The <i>Batrachosperm&aelig;</i> bear a strong resemblance to frog-spawn,
from which they derive their name, and are chiefly a marine
group of algals allied to the Rhodesperme&aelig; or red seaweeds. The
late Dr. A. Hassall first described them; they have since received
more careful attention from M. Sirodot. They are reddish-green,
extremely flexible, and nothing can surpass the grace of their
movements in water; but when removed from their element they
lose all form, and resemble a jelly-like substance without a trace
of organisation; but if allowed to remain quiet they regain their
original shape.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span></p>

<p>The presence of the cell-membrane will be best demonstrated
by breaking up the filaments, either by moving the thin glass cover,
or by cutting through a mass of them in all directions with a fine
dissecting knife. On now examining the slide, in most instances
many detached empty pieces of the cell-membrane, with its stri&aelig;, will
be seen, as well as filaments partly deprived of protoplasm. On the
application of iodine all these appearances become more distinguishable
in consequence of the filament turning red or brown, while the
empty cells remain either unaffected, or present a slight yellowish
tint, as is frequently the case with cellulose when old.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_285" src="images/fig_285.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 285.&mdash;<i>Mesoglia
vermicularis.</i></p></div>

<p>With regard to the contents of the cell,
the endochrome is coloured in the Oscillatori&aelig;,
and is distinguishable by circular
bands or rings around the axis of the cylindrical
filament. Iodine stains them brown
or red, and syrup and dilute sulphuric acid
produce a beautiful rose colour. As to their
mode of propagation, nothing positive is
known. If kept for some time they gradually
lose their green colour; a portion of the
mass, becoming brown, sinks to the bottom
of the vessel, and presents a granular layer.</p>

<p><i>Mesoglia vermicularis</i> (<a href="#fig_285">Fig. 285</a>) consists
of strings of cells cohering and held together
by their membranous covering. In the lowly organised plant
Vaucheria (<a href="#pl_i">Plate I</a>., No. 23, <i>V. sessilis</i>)&mdash;so named after its discoverer
Vaucher, a German botanist&mdash;a genus of Siphonace&aelig;, we
have an example of true processes of sexual generation. The
branching filaments are often seen to bear at their sides peculiar
globular bodies or oval protuberances, nipple-shaped buddings-out
of the cell-wall, filled with a dark-coloured endochrome and distributed
in pairs, one of which curves round to meet the other,
when conjugation is seen to take place. Near these bodies others
are found with pointed projections, which have been described as
“horns,” but these, Pringshelm says, are “antherids which produce
antherozoids in their interior,” while the capsule-like bodies constituting
the oospores become, when fertilised, a new generation, which
swarm out through a cavity or aperture in the parent cell-wall.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span></p>

<p>The fruit of fresh-water and most olive-green algals is enclosed in
spherical cavities under the epidermis of the frond, termed conceptacles,
and may be either male or female. The zoids are bottle-shaped
and have flagella; the transparent vesicle in which they are
contained is itself enclosed in a second of similar form. In monœcious
and diœcious algals the female conceptacles are distinguished from the
male by their olive colour. The spores, when developed, are borne
on a pedicle emanating from the inner wall of the conceptacle.
They rupture the outer wall at its apex; at first the spore appears
simple, but soon after a series of changes takes place, consisting in
a splitting up of the endochrome into six or eight masses of spheroidal
bodies. A budding-out occurs in a few hours’ time, and ultimately
elongates into a cylindrical thread. The Vaucheria present a double
mode of reproduction, and their fronds consist of branching tubes
resembling in their general character that of the Bryophyta, from
which indeed they differ only in respect of the arrangement of their
green contents. In that most remarkable plant <i>Saprolegnia ferox</i>,
which is structurally so closely allied to Vaucheria, though separated
from them by the absence of green colouring matter, a corresponding
analogy in the processes of development takes place. In the formation
of its zoospores, an intermediate step is presented between that
of the alg&aelig; and a class of plants formally placed among fungi.</p>

<p><i>The Ulvace&aelig;.</i>&mdash;The typical form of seaweeds is the <i>Ulva lactuca</i>,
well known from its fronds of dark-green “laver” on every coast
throughout the world. Ulv&aelig; are seen to differ but little from
the preceding group of fresh-water algals. The specific difference
is that the cells, when multiplied by binary subdivision, not only
remain in firm connection with each other but possess a more
regular arrangement. The frond plane of the algal is either more
simple or lobed, and is formed of a double layer of cells closely
packed together and producing zoospores. The whole group is
chiefly distinguished from Porphyra by their green colour, the latter
being roseate or purple. Ulv&aelig; are mostly marine, with one or two
exceptions. One species (<i>U. thermalis</i>) grows in the hot springs of
Gastein, in a temperature of about 117&deg; Fahr. The development
of Ulv&aelig; is seen in <a href="#fig_286">Fig. 286</a>. The isolated cells, <small>A</small>, resemble in some
points those of the Protococcus; these give rise to successive
subdivisions determining the clusters seen at <small>B</small> and <small>C</small>, and by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
their aggregation to the confervoid filament shown at <small>D</small>. These
filaments increase in length and breadth by successive additions,
and finally take the form of fronds, or rows of cells.</p>

<p>The marine greenish-olive alg&aelig; present a general appearance
which might at first sight be mistaken for plants of a higher order
of cryptogams. Their fronds have no longer the form of a filament,
but assume that of a membranous expansion of cells. The
cells in which zoospores are found have an increased quantity of
coloured protoplasm accumulated towards one point of the cell-wall;
while the zoospores are observed to converge with their apices
towards the same point. In some alg&aelig;, which seem to be closely
related in form and structure to the Bryophyta, we notice this
important difference, that the zoospores are developed in an organ
specially destined for the purpose, presenting peculiarities of form
and distinguishing it from other parts of the branching tubular
frond. In the genus Derbesia distinct spore cases develop, a young
branch of which, when destined to become a spore case, instead of
elongating indefinitely, begins, after having arrived at a certain
length, to swell out into an ovoid vesicle, in the cavity of which
a considerable accumulation of protoplasm takes place. This is
separated from the rest of the plant, and becomes an opaque mass,
surrounded by a distinct membrane. After a time a division of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
the mass takes place, and a number of pyriform zoospores, each
of which is furnished with flagella, are set free.</p>

<p>In <i>Cutleria</i> (<a href="#fig_288">Fig. 288</a>) we have a special feature of interest with
two kinds of organs, seemingly opposed to each other with regard to
their reproductive functions. The sporangia not only differ from those
of other species, but the frond consists of olive-coloured irregularly-divided
flagella, on each side of which tufts (<i>sori</i>) consisting of the
reproductive organs, intermixed with hair-like bodies, are scattered.
The zoospores are divided by transverse
partitions into four cavities,
each of which is again bisected by a
longitudinal median septum. When
first thrown off they are in appearance
so much like the spores of
Puccinia that they may be mistaken
for them, although so very much
larger than those of other olive-coloured
alg&aelig;.</p>

<p><i>Floride&aelig;</i>, the red alg&aelig; (<a href="#pl_ii">Plate II</a>.),
present many varieties of structure,
although less appears to be known
of their reproductive processes than
of lower forms of cryptogamic plants.
These are, however, of three kinds.
The first, to which the term polyspore
has been applied, is that of a
gelatinous or membranous pericarp
or conceptacle, in which an indefinite
number of zoospores are contained. This organ may be either
at the summit or base of a branch, or it may be concealed in or
below the cortical layer of the stem. In some cases a number of
spore-bearing filaments emanate from a kind of membrane at the
base of a spheroidal cellular perisporangium, by the rupture of
which the zoospores formed from the endochrome of the filaments
make their escape. Other changes have been observed; however,
they all agree in one particular, namely, that the zoospore is
developed in the interior of a cell, the wall of which forms its
perispore, and the internal protoplasmic membrane endochrome, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
zoospore itself, for the escape of which the perispore opens out at
its apex.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p class="hang">Fig. 289.&mdash;<i>Dasya
kutzingiana</i>, with

Magnified

<p>The second form is more simple, and consists of a globular or ovoid
cell, containing a central granular mass; this ultimately divides into
four quadrate-shaped spores; these, on attaining maturity, escape
by rupture of the cell-wall. Another organ, called a tetraspore,
takes its origin in the cortical layer. The tetraspores are arranged
either in an isolated manner along the branches, or in numbers
together; in some instances the branches that
contain them are so modified in form they look
like special organs, and have been called stichidia;
as, for example, in Dasya (<a href="#fig_289">Fig. 289</a>). Of the
third kind of reproductive organ a difference of
opinion exists as to the signification of their
antheridia; although always produced in precisely
the same situations as the tetraspores and
polyspores, they are agglomerations of little
colourless cells, either united in a bunch, as in
Griffithsia, or enclosed in a transparent cylinder,
as in Polysiphonia, or covering a kind of expanded
disc of peculiar form, as in Laurencia. According
to competent observers, the cells contain spermatozoids.
N&auml;geli describes the spermatozoid as a
spiral fibre, which, as it escapes, lengthens itself
in the form of a screw. Thuret, on the contrary,
says the contents are granular, and offer no trace
of a spiral filament, but are expelled from the
cells by a slow motion. The antheridia appear in
their most simple form in Callithamnion (<a href="#pl_ii">Plate II</a>., Nos. 32 and 34),
being reduced to a small mass of cells composed by numerous
little bunches which are sessile on the bifurcations of the terminal
branches. The spores are simpler structures than the tetraspores,
and mostly occupy a more important position. They are not
scattered through the frond, but grouped in definite masses, and
generally enclosed in a special capsule or conceptacle, which may
be mistaken for a tetraspore case. The simplest form of the spore
fruit consists of spherical masses of spores attached to the wall
of the frond, or imbedded in its substance, without a proper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
conceptacle; such a fruit is called a <i>favellidium</i>, and occurs in
Halymenia; the same name is applied to the fruits of similar
structures not perfectly immersed, as those of Gigartina, Gelidium,
&amp;c., where they form tubercular swellings on the lobes. In some,
the tubercles present a pore at the summit, through which the spores
emerge forth. In other cases, as in Ceramium (<a href="#pl_ii">Plate II</a>., Nos. 27
and 37), the spores occupy a more conspicuous place; a characteristic
species is Delessaria (<a href="#pl_ii">Plate II</a>., No. 39), the coccidium either occurring
on lateral branches, or is sessile on the face of the frond, when it
consists of a case filled with angular-shaped spores attached to the
wall of the case. The general external appearance of the red alg&aelig;
is very varied, but it seems to attain to its deepest colouring in the
Red Sea, which, it is said, is entirely due to the peculiarly vivid red
seaweed. They are all exquisite objects for the microscope, as may
be surmised from the few varieties presented in <a href="#pl_ii">Plate II</a>. The
Floride&aelig; of the warmer seas exhibit most elegantly formed fronds, as
will be seen on reference to the “Phycologia Australica” of the late
Dr. William Harvey, F.R.S.</p>

<p>The Charace&aelig; may be placed among the highest of the algals, if
only for the complexity of their reproductive organs, which certainly
offer a contrast in their simplicity of structure. <i>Chara vulgaris</i>,
stonewort, is a simple fresh-water plant, preferring still freshwater
ponds or slow-moving rivers running over a chalky soil. It
thus derives the calcareous matter found in the axis of the plant,
together with a small portion of silica. Its filaments (or branches,
as some botanists prefer to call them) are given off in whorls.
The Charace&aelig; are a small family of acrogens, consisting of only
two or three at most. They are monœcious and diœcious, the two
kinds of fruit being often placed close together. They may easily
be grown in a tall glass jar for observation. All that is necessary
is to put the jar occasionally under the house tap and let the water
run slowly over the top for a short time, thus renewing the contents
without disturbing the plant. The hard water supplied to London
suits chara better than softer water. Both chara and nitella are objects
of great interest to microscopists, since in the former the important
fact of vegetable circulation was first observed. A portion of the
plant of the natural size is shown in <a href="#fig_290">Fig. 290</a>, No. 1.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span></p>

the course taken by the chlorophyll); 3. A limb, with buds protruding;
4. Portion of a leaf of <i>Vallisneria spiralis</i>, showing cyclosis of chlorophyll granules.</p></div>

<p>Each plant is composed of an assemblage of long tubiform cells
placed end to end, with fixed intervals, around which the branchlets
are disposed with great regularity. In nitella the stem and branches
are composed of simple cells, which sometimes attain to several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
inches in length. Each <i>node</i>, or zone, from which the branches
spring, consists of a single plate, or layer, of small cells, which
are a continuation of the cortical layer of the internode (<a href="#fig_290">Fig. 290</a>,
No. 3) as an outgrowth. Each cell is partially filled with chlorophyll
granules, and it is these that are seen under the microscope
taking the course shown by the arrows (<a href="#fig_290">Fig. 290</a>, No. 2). The
rate of movement of the granules is accelerated by moderate
warmth and retarded by cold. It is in viewing the circulation in
water plants that the warm stage of the microscope is brought
into use. Borne along with the protoplasmic stream are a number
of solid particles consisting of starch granules and other matters.
The method of viewing the circulation is by cutting sections off a
portion of the plant with a very sharp knife, and arranging them
in a growing cell with a few drops of water, and covering over
with a thin cover-glass.</p>

<p>The reproductive process of Chara is effected by two sets of bodies,
both of which are placed at the base of the branches (<a href="#fig_291">Fig. 291</a>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
<small>E</small> and <small>D</small>) either on the same or different plants, one set known
as globules or <i>antherids</i>, and the other as nucules, containing the
oospores or <i>archegones</i>. These are often of a bright red colour,
and have covering plates, or shields (<small>B</small> and <small>E</small>), curiously marked,
and the central portion is composed of a number of filaments rolled
up (as in <small>E</small>) or free (as seen at <small>B</small>), projecting out from the centre
of the sphere. The antherid is supported on a short flask-shaped
pedicle, which projects into the interior. At the apex of each of
the eight manubria is a roundish hyaline cell, termed a capitulum,
and at its apex again six smaller or secondary capitula. The long
whip-shaped filaments are divided by transverse septa into a
hundred or more compartments, every one of which is filled with
an antherozoid (as at <small>A</small>), consisting of a spiral thread of protoplasm
packed into two or three coils; these escape and become
free (as seen at <small>C</small>), each having two long fine flagella. The
young antherozoid swims off with a lashing action, and the whole
field appears for a time filled with life. They swim about freely,
but their motion gradually ceases, and soon they arrive at a state
of inaction.</p>

<p><i>Nitella</i> appears to have a somewhat different mode of fructification
to that of its congener. It puts forth a long filamentous
branch from one of its joints, which, on reaching the surface of
the water, terminates in a whitish fruit-like cluster. It is even
a more delicate and less robust algal than chara, and every care
should be taken to imitate the still water in which it grows. It
delights in shady woods and in calcareous open pools.</p>

<p>Similar care is requisite with regard to Vallisneria; and a more
equal temperature is better suited to the growth of this aquatic
plant. It should be planted in the middle of the jar or aquarium,
about two inches deep in mould, closely pressed down, then gently
fill the jar with water. When the water requires changing, a small
portion only should be run off at a time. It appears to thrive in
proportion to the frequency of changing the water, and taking care
that the water added rather increases the temperature than lowers it.</p>

<p>The natural habitat of the <i>Frog-bit</i>, another water-plant of much
interest, is found on the surface of ponds and ditches; in the autumn
its seeds fall, and become buried in the mud at the bottom during
the winter; in the spring these plants rise to the surface, produce
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
flowers, and grow throughout the summer. Chara may be found in
many places around London, and in the upper reaches of the Thames.</p>

<p><i>Anacharis alsinastrum.</i>&mdash;This remarkable plant is so unlike any
other water-plant that it may be at once recognised by its leaves
growing <i>in threes</i> round a slender stem. It is also known as
“Waterthyme,” from a resemblance it bears to that plant.</p>

<p>The colour of the plant is deep green; the leaves are nearly half
an inch long, by an eighth wide, egg-shaped at the point, with serrated
edges. Its powers of increase are prodigious, as every fragment
is capable of becoming an independent plant, producing roots
and stems, and extending itself indefinitely in every direction. The
specific gravity of it is so nearly that of water, that it is more disposed
to sink than float. A small branch of the plant is represented,
with a hydra attached to it, in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>The special cells in which the circulation is most readily seen
are the elongated cells around the margin of the leaf and those
of the midrib. On examining the leaf with polarised light, the cells
are observed to contain a large proportion of silica, and present
a very interesting appearance. A bright band of light encircles the
leaf, and traverses its centre. In fact, the leaf is set, as it were, in
a framework of silica. By boiling the leaf for a short time in equal
parts of nitric acid and water, a portion of the vegetable tissue is
destroyed, and the silica rendered more distinct, without changing
the form of the leaf.</p>

<p>It is necessary to make a thin section or strip from the leaf of
Vallisneria for the purpose of exhibiting the circulation in the cells,
as shown in <a href="#fig_290">Fig. 290</a>, No. 4. Among the cell granules, a few of
a more transparent character than the rest, are seen to have a
nucleolus within.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of cell cyclosis occurs in other plants beside
those growing in water. The leaf of the common plantain or dock,
Plantago, furnishes a good example, the movement being seen both
in the cells of the plant and hairs of the cuticle torn from the
midrib.</p>

<p><i>Cell-division.</i>&mdash;In order to study the process of cell-division the
hairs on the stamens of Tradescantia should be taken. Remove one
from a bud on a warm day and let a drop of a one per cent. sugar
solution fall upon it, and cover it with a thin glass cover. Place it for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
a short time in a <i>moist-chamber</i> (<a href="#fig_256">Fig. 256</a>), and then examine it with
a magnifying power of 500 diameters. The nucleus of the cell
will be seen, near its terminal position, to gradually elongate in the
direction of the longer axis of the cell and become more granular,
while the protoplasm moves towards the extreme end; the nucleus
at the same time will present a striated appearance, with the fibrilla
arranged parallel to the longer axis of the nucleus, and at length
approach each other at the poles. A nuclear spindle will now be
produced, and the fibres ruptured in the equatorial plane, so that two
nuclei will be found in place of the one. The best preparations of
nuclei are obtained by making thin longitudinal sections of actively-growing
plants (young rootlets of Pinus, for example), and staining
them with h&aelig;matoxylin in the manner described in a former chapter.</p>

<h3>Desmidiace&aelig; and Diatomace&aelig;.</h3>

<p>The two groups of Desmidiace&aelig; and Diatomace&aelig; differ so little in
their general characters that they may be spoken of as members or
representative families of microscopic and unicellular alg&aelig; alike in
their remarkable beauty and bilateral symmetry, and of such peculiar
interest as to call for special notice. Desmids differ from diatoms
chiefly in colour, in lacking a non-silicious skeleton, and in their
generative process, which for the most part consists in the conjugation
of two similar cells. Diatoms, on the other hand, have dense
silicious skeletons and a general absence of green colouring matter.
Ralfs, in his systematic monograph, enumerates twenty genera of
desmids. The limiting membrane is alike firm and flexible, since
it exhibits some elasticity and resistance to pressure, and is not
readily decomposable. Traces of silica are found in only a few of
the desmids, while the frustule of the diatom is chiefly composed of
this substance; both have an external membranous covering, so
transparent and homogeneous in structure as to be in danger of
being entirely overlooked, unless some staining material is used,
together with a high-power objective possessing considerable penetration.
In some species, however, the mucous covering is more
clearly defined, as in Staurastrum and <i>Didymoprium Grevelli</i>.
Openings occur in the outer membrane of other species, as the
Closterium.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption">PLATE X.</p>
<img id="pl_x" src="images/pl_x.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">DESMIDIACE&AElig;.</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span></p></div>

<p>Many species of desmids have a power of motion, the cause of which
must be due either to cilia or a flagellate organ. This, however, is
denied by some observers, who regard their movements as due to
an exudation of the mucilaginous contents of the cell, to exosmose,
or diffusion, neither of which hypotheses will at all help us to
understand the gliding movements of the Oscillari&aelig; or the sharp
jerky movement of the Schizonema. The movements of desmids
are especially exerted when in the act of dividing, and by sunlight,
towards which they are always observed to move. The force with
which some diatoms move about is very great, and this can only
be satisfactorily explained by admitting a specialised organ.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Desmidiace&aelig; (<a href="#pl_x">Plate X</a>.) is much modified
by their eminences, depressions, and processes, as well as that of
the surface, the margin of the fronds, and the depth and width
of the central constriction. The surfaces may be dotted over
irregularly, the dots themselves being elevated or depressed points
in their structural character. The margins of some have a dentate
appearance, as in Cosmarium. In the elongated forms, such as
Penium, the puncta are disposed in lines parallel to the length.
In several these lines are either elevations or furrows, it is not
always easy to say which; they are peculiar, however, to the
elongated forms of Closterium. When the lines are fine they
produce a striation of the surface, but in order to discover this the
fronds should be viewed when empty and by a fairly good power.
The modification of surface in several genera seems to be due,
not to mere simple appendages, but to expansion of the limiting
membrance into thickened processes, and which may terminate in
spines, as in Xanthidium and Staurastrum (<a href="#pl_x">Plate X</a>., Nos. 8-19 and
22). A general distribution over the surface is characteristic of the
former, but in Euastrum the surfaces are very irregular, and therefore
described as “swellings or inflations.” Micrasterias has its margin
deeply incised into lobes, which in some have a radiating arrangement;
when the lobes on the margin are small they constitute
crenations or dentations. The fronds of <i>Euastrum binatum</i> are
bicrenate on the sides, as are those of Desmidium and Hyalotheca
and other species. Another variety of margin exists, known as
undulating or wavy, while the general concavity or convexity of
the margins furnish other specific characteristics.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span></p>

<p><i>Pediastre&aelig;</i> (<a href="#pl_x">Plate X</a>., Nos. 24-29).&mdash;The members of this family
formerly included the Micrasterias and Arthrodesmius of Ehrenberg.
From their arrangement of cells in determinate numbers and definite
forms, it has been thought by some observers that they should
be removed from the desmids to a special or sub-family. The
points of difference consist in the firmness of the outer covering,
in the frequent interruptions on the margin of the cells, and in
the protrusion of “horns,” or rather a notch more or less deep. It
is true that the cells are not made up of two symmetrical halves,
and that they are in aggregation, which is not (except in the
Scenedesmus, a genus that distinctly connects this group with
desmids) in linear series, but in the form of discoidal fronds.
They, however, divide into 8, 16, or 32 gonidia, and these move
about for some time before the formation of a new frond. It
was N&auml;geli who first instituted a sub-genus of Pediastrum, under
the designation of Anomopedium, the chief characteristic of which
is the absence of bilobed peripheral cells. In Cœlastrum the cells
are hexangular, the central ones very regularly so; in Sorastrum
they are wedge-shaped, or triangular, with rounded-off angles. Viewed
laterally the cells appear oblong. The cells of Pediastrum are considerably
compressed, so that when aggregated they form a flattened
tubular structure; in figure they are polygonal, frequently hexagonal,
a shape owing, in all probability, to mutual lateral pressure during
growth. There is a pervading uniformity in the contents of the
cells of the different genera, which consist of protoplasmic endochrome.
At first the colour is pale green, but it becomes deeper
with full maturity, while the decaying cells are seen to change to
a deep reddish-yellow or brown. The protoplasm is also clear and
homogeneous, but in time granules appear, enlarge, and multiply
in number; moreover, each cell presents a single bright green
vesicle, around which are collected clear circular spaces or globules,
recalling those of Closterium, and varying in number from two to
six or more, their position not being regulated by the partition wall
as in Palmell&aelig;, but by the centre of the entire frond. Oil globules
are also contained in the cells; their presence is indicated by the
addition of a drop of tincture of iodine. On one occasion N&auml;geli
saw in <i>Pediastrum boryanum</i> the endochrome disposed in a radiating
manner, an arrangement which often obtains in algals and in other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
vegetable cells with a central nucleus. The cells of Pediastre&aelig;
are always united together in compound fronds, as represented in
<a href="#pl_x">Plate X</a>., Nos. 24 and 29.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>The differences pointed out in no way constitute a claim to
remove Pediastre&aelig; from among Desmidiace&aelig;, certainly not to rank as
a distinct species.</p>

<p><i>Reproduction of Desmidiace&aelig;.</i>&mdash;A true reproductive act is presented
by the conjugation or coupling of two fronds, and by the resulting
development of a sporangium and subsequent interchange of the
contents of the two cells. At another time self-division is frequently
seen to take place in all respects as in the cells of other alg&aelig;. The
proceeding is varied in some essential particulars by the form of
the fronds and by other circumstances; as in fission of Euastrum, for
instance (seen in <a href="#pl_x">Plate X</a>., Nos. 1, 2, and 12), when the narrow connecting
bands between the two segments of the fronds are rapidly
pushed aside by growth and finally divide. Two modes of conjugation
of fronds are represented in <a href="#pl_x">Plate X</a>., Nos. 25 and 33,
in Closterium and Penium. The act of conjugation admits of
variations in character, as shown in Staurastrum and Microsterias;
the contents of both fronds are discharged into a delicate intermediate
sac; this gradually thickens and produces spines (<a href="#pl_x">Plate X</a>.,
Nos. 8 and 19). In Didymoprium the separate joints unite by a
narrow process pushed out from each other, often of considerable
length, through which the endochrome of one cell is transferred
to the other, and thus a sporangium is produced within one of
two cells, just as in the conjugat&aelig; (No. 5). In <i>Penium Jennereri</i>
the conjugation takes a varied form; the fronds do not open and
gape at the suture, but couple by small but distinct cylindrical
tubes (No. 27).</p>

<p>Among those enumerated, the compressed and deeply constricted
cells of Euastrum offer the more favourable opportunities for studying
the manner of their division; for although the frond is really a
single cell, in all its stages it appears like two, the segments being
always distinct, from the earliest stage. The segments, however, are
separated by a connecting link, which is subsequently converted into
two somewhat round hyaline bodies. These bodies gradually increase
and acquire colour, and as they grow the original segments are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
further divided, and at length become disconnected, each taking a
new segment to supply the place of that from which it is separated.
It is curious to trace the progressive development of the newer
portions, which at first are devoid of all colour; but as they become
larger a faint green tint is observed, which gradually darkens, and
then assumes a granular appearance. Soon the new segments attain
their normal size, while the covering in some species shows the presence
of puncta. In Xanthidium, <a href="#pl_x">Plate X</a>., Nos. 9, 10, and Staurastrum,
Nos. 15-18, the spines and processes make their appearance last,
beginning as mere tubercles, and then lengthening until they attain
their perfect form and size, armed with set&aelig;; but complete separation
frequently occurs before growth is fully completed. This singular
process is repeated again and again, so that the older segments are
united successively, as it were, with many generations. When the cells
approach maturity, molecular movements may be at times noticed in
their contents, precisely similar to what Agardh and others aptly
term “swarming.” Meyen describes this granular matter as
starch.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> Closterium, early in the spring, when freshly secured
and exposed to light, presents a wonderful appearance, these bodies
being kept continually in motion at both ends of the frustule by
the ciliary action within the cell, and the whole frond is seen
brilliantly glittering with active cilia. When a gleam of stronger
light is allowed for a moment to fall on the frond, the rapid undulations
of the cilia produce a series of most delicate prismatic
Newton’s rings. The action and distribution of the cilia, together
with the cyclosis of the granular bodies in the frond, are better
seen by the aid of Wenham’s parabola or a good condenser with
a central stop. One of the wide angular objectives shows the
circulation around the marginal portions of the whole frond. The
stream is seen to be running up the more external portion, internal
to which is another stream following a contrary direction; this
action, confined to the space between the mass of endochrome and
the outer portion of the cell-wall, is seen to pass above or around
the space in which cyclosis of the spores is taking place.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span></p>

<p>During the summer of 1854, the late Rev. Lord Sidney Godolphin
Osborne and myself became much interested in the remarkable family
of Closteria. <a href="#fig_292">Fig. 292</a> is a highly magnified view of <i>Closterium
lunula</i> which I drew by the aid of the camera-lucida at the time.
There could be no doubt about the ciliary action within the frond:
it was in every way similar to that of the branchi&aelig; of the muscle,
the same wavy motion, which gradually became slower as the death
of the desmid drew near. This was brought about earlier when the
cell was not kept supplied with fresh water.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 292.&mdash;<i>Closterium lunula.</i></p></div>

<p>In diagram A, line <i>b</i> points to a cluster of ovoid bodies; these are
seen at intervals throughout the endochrome within the investing
membrane. These bodies are attached to the membrane by small
pedicles, and are occasionally seen in motion about the spot, from
which they eventually break away, and are carried off, by the circulating
fluid, to the chambers at the extremities of the frond; there
they join a crowd of similar bodies, in constant motion within the
chambers, when the specimen is quite fresh. That the action of
these free granules or spores is “Brownian,” as surmised by some
writers, is in my opinion entirely fallacious. It is doubtless in a
measure due to the current brought about by the ciliary motion of
the more fluid contents of the cell.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span></p>

<p>The circulation, when made out over the centre of the frond, for
instance at <i>a</i>, is in appearance of a wholly different nature from that
seen at the edges. In the latter the matter circulated is that of
granules, passing each other in distinct lines, but in opposite directions;
in the circulation as seen at <i>a</i>, the streams are broad,
tortuous, of far greater body, and passing with much less rapidity.
To see the centre circulation, use a Gillett’s illuminator and a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>th or a
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>th immersion; work the fine adjustment so as to bring the centre of
the frond into focus, then almost lose it by raising the objective;
after this, with great care, work the milled head until the darker body
of the endochrome is clearly brought out.</p>

<p>At B is an enlarged sketch of one extremity of the frond. The
arrows within the chamber pointing to <i>b</i> denote the direction of a
strong current of fluid, which can be occasionally followed throughout.
It is acted upon by cilia at the edges of the chamber, the
greater impetus appearing to come from the centre of the endochrome.
The fluid is here acting in positive jets, that is, with an almost
arterial action; and according to the strength with which it is propelled
at the time, the loose floating bodies are sent to a greater or
less distance from the end of the frustule; the fluid is thus impelled
from a centre, and kept in activity by the lateral cilia, that create a
rapid current and give a turning motion to the free bodies. The line&mdash;<i>a</i>,
in this diagram, denotes the outline of the membrane which
encloses the endochrome; on both sides cilia can be seen. The
circulation exterior to it passes and repasses in opposite directions,
in three or four distinct courses; these, when they arrive at&mdash;<i>c</i>,
seem to encounter a stream making its way towards an aperture at
the apex of the chamber; then they appear to be driven back again
by a stronger force. Some, however, do occasionally enter the
chamber, but very rarely will one of the bodies escape into the outer
current, and should it do so, is carried about until it becomes
adherent to the side wall of the frond.</p>

<p>With regard to the propagation of the <i>C. lunula</i>, I have never
seen anything like conjugation; but I have repeatedly seen self-division
(shown at D <i>a</i> <i>a</i>). This act is chiefly the work of one half of
the frond. Having watched for some time, one half is seen to remain
passive, while the other has a lateral motion from side to side, as
if moving on an axis at the point of juncture; the motion increases,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
is more active, until at last with a jerk one segment separates itself
from the other, as seen at E. It will be noticed that each end of the
segment is perfectly closed before separation finally takes place;
there is, however, only one perfect chamber, that belonging to the
extremity of the original entire frond. The circulation continues for
some time previous to and after subdivision, in both fronds, and by
almost imperceptible degrees increases in volume. From the end of
the endochrome symptoms of elongation of the frond take place, the
semi-lunar form gradually changes, elongates, and is more defined, until
it takes the form and outline of the fully-formed frustule at the
extremity. The obtuse end&mdash;<i>b</i> of the other portion of frond is at the
same time elongating and contracting, and in a few hours from the
division of the one segment from the other the appearance of each
half is that of a nearly perfect frustule, the chamber at the new end is
complete, the globular circulation exterior to it becomes affected by
the circulation from within the said chamber, and, shortly afterwards,
some of the free bodies descend, and become exposed to the current
already going on in the chamber. E is a diagram of one end of a
<i>C. didymotocum</i>, in which the same process was well marked, and
completed while it was under observation.</p>

<p>It will appear to most observers that if the continuation of the
widely-spread family of Desmidiace&aelig; was wholly dependent upon
conjugation and subdivision of their frustules, a process requiring
several hours for its completion, the whole species must have long
ago disappeared. It may be presumed then that some other mode of
reproduction must prevail. In the fresh-water alg&aelig; the two more
general methods of multiplication are clearly governed by the conditions
of the seasons; the resting-spores securing continuity of life
during the winter, the swarm-spores spreading the plant profusely
during the warmer portion of the year, when rapid growth is possible.
I therefore regard the actively swarming bodies seen in continuous
motion at the two extreme portions of the frustule of <i>Closterium
lunula</i> as being either oospores or zoospores, by means of which
reproduction takes place.</p>

<p><b>Diatomace&aelig;</b>, commonly called brittleworts, <a href="#pl_xi">Plate XI</a>., are chiefly
composed of two symmetrical valves, narrow and wand-like, navicular,
miniature boat-shaped, hence their name <i>Navicula</i> (little ship).
Hitherto they have excited the deepest interest among microscopists
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
because of their wonderfully minute structure, and the difficulty
involved in determining their exact nature and formation. Each
individual diatom has a silicious skeleton, spoken of as a frustule,
frond, or cell, having a rectangular or prismatic form, which mostly
obtains in the whole family, the angles of the junction of the two united
valves being, as a rule, acute, and enclosing a yellowish-brown endochrome.
Deeply-notched frustules, like those of the Desmidiace&aelig;, do
not occur, and the production of spines and tubercles so common in
that family is rare in the Diatomace&aelig;. Great variety of outline
prevails, so much so that no rule in this respect can be formulated.</p>

<p>The frustules, however, are usually composed of two equal and
similar halves, but exceptions to this are found in the Actinomthe&aelig;,
Cocconcid&aelig;, and one or two other families. The extremities of some
species, <i>e.g.</i>, Nitzshia and Pleurosigma, are extremely elongated, forming
long, filiform, tubular processes; in Biddulphia and Rizoselenia,
short tubular processes from their margins. Great variety of outline
may prevail in a genus, so considerable indeed that no accurate
definition can be given, the characteristics shading off through several
species until the similarity to an assumed typical form is much
diminished, which may again be modified by accidental circumstances
that surround the development of the silicious frustule. It must
not be forgotten that the figure is greatly modified or entirely
changed by the position of the valves, whether seen in one position
or another, as already explained in connection with “Errors
of Interpretation.” Again, in the genera Navicula, Pinnularia
(<a href="#pl_ii">Plate II</a>., Nos. 33, 38, and 40), and others, the frustules are in one
aspect boat-shaped, but in the other either oblong with truncated
ends, or prismatic. In the genus Triceratium (<a href="#pl_xi">Plate XI</a>., No. 10),
the difference of figure is very remarkable as the front or side view
is examined.</p>

<p>The sudden change in appearance presented to the eye as the
frustule is seen to roll over is rather peculiar. As a rule, therefore,
we must examine all specimens in every aspect, to accomplish
which very shallow cells should be selected, say of <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub>th of an inch
deep, and covered with glass <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>250</sub>th of an inch thick. A good penetrating
objective should be used, and careful illumination obtained.
The Diatomace&aelig; are perhaps more widely distributed than any other
class of infusorial life; they are found in fresh, salt, and brackish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
water; many grow attached to other bodies by a stalk (<a href="#pl_ii">Plate II</a>.,
No. 33, Licmophora and Achnanthidium); while others, as Pleurosigma,
No. 40, swim about freely.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">DIATOMACE&AElig;, RECENT AND FOSSIL.</span></p></div>

<p>There are a considerable number of Diatomace&aelig; which, when in
the young state, are enclosed in a muco-gelatinous sheath; while
others are attached by stipes or stalk to alg&aelig;. It would be vain,
in a limited space, to attempt a description of this numerous and
extensive family. N&auml;geli and other observers describe a “mucilaginous
pellicle on the inner layer of the valves,” while, as Menghine
observes, “an organic membrane ought to exist both inside and outside,
for the silica could not become solid except by crystallizing or depositing
itself on some pre-existing substance.” The surface of the frustules
is generally very beautifully sculptured, and the markings assume
the appearance of dots (puncta), stripes (stri&aelig;), ribs (cost&aelig;), pinnules
(pinn&aelig;), of furrows and fine lines; longitudinal, transverse, and
radiating bands; canals or canaliculi; and of cells or areol&aelig;; whilst
all present striking varieties and modifications in their form, character,
and degree of development. Again, the fine lines or stri&aelig; of many
frustules are resolvable into rows of minute dots or perforations, as
occur in <i>Pleurosigma angulatum</i>, delineated in the accompanying
microphotograph (<a href="#fig_294">Fig. 294</a>), taken for the author purposely to
show the markings on this especially selected test diatom.</p>

<p>The nature of the markings on the diatom valves is one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
considerable interest, and attempts have been made to produce them
artificially, but without success.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">(From a microphotograph taken by Zeiss with the 2 mm. aprochromatic objective,
1·30 numerical aperture, and projection eye-piece, No. 4.)</p></div>

<p>Professor Max Schultze devoted a great amount of time to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
investigation of the subject, and has recorded in a voluminous paper<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>
the results of his observations. He says, “Most of the species of
the Diatomace&aelig; are characterised by the presence on their outer
surface of certain differences of relief, referable either to elevations or
to depressions disposed in rows. The opinions of microscopists with
respect to the nature of these markings are still somewhat divided.
Whilst in the larger forms, and those distinguished by their coarser
dots, the appearance is manifestly due to the existence of thinner
spots in the valve, we cannot so easily explain the cause of the striation
or punctation in <i>Pleurosigma angulatum</i> and similar finely-marked
forms.”</p>

<p>Dr. R. Zeiss some time ago furnished me with a microphotograph
of a frustule magnified 4500 diameters that seemed to confirm Mr.
T. F. Smith’s view of the structure of these valves. Dr. Van Heurck
has also made a study of this diatom, and concludes that the valves
consist of two membranes of thin films, and of an intermediate layer,
the outer being pierced with openings. The outer membrane is, he
believes, “so delicate that it is easily destroyed by acid or by friction,
and the several processes employed in cleaning and preparing it for
microscopical examination. When the openings or apertures of the
internal portion are arranged in alternate rows they assume the
hexagonal form; when in straight rows, the openings are seen to be
square or oblong.” A description hardly in accord with <a href="#fig_294">Fig. 294</a>.</p>

<h3>Movements of Diatoms.</h3>

<p>The late Professor Smith, in his “Synopsis of Diatoms,” refers
to their movements in the following terms: “I am constrained to
believe that the movements observed in the Diatomace&aelig; are due to
forces operating within the frustule, and are probably connected with
the endosmotic and exosmotic action of the cells. The fluids which
are concerned in these actions must enter, and be emitted through
the minute foramina at the extremities of the silicious valves.”
Schultze’s researches, which were made at a later date, carried this
debatable question somewhat further. He is of opinion “that a
sarcode (protoplasmic) substance envelops the external surface of
the diatoms, and its movements are due to this agent exclusively.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
His investigations were mainly confined to <i>P. angulatum</i>, and to
the larger <i>P. attenuatum</i> (<a href="#fig_293">Fig. 293</a>, 1 and 2), as the transverse
markings on the frustule do not impede to so great an extent the
observation of what is going on within. The living specimen of
<i>P. angulatum</i> under the microscope usually has its broad side turned
to view, with one long curved “raphe” uppermost, and the other
in contact with the glass cover (<a href="#fig_293">Fig. 293</a>). Within the frustule the
yellow colouring matter, “endochrome,” fills the cavity more or
less completely. In the broader part of the frustule these bands of
endochrome describe one or two complicated windings. It is only
possible in those specimens in which the bands are narrow to properly
trace their foldings, and determine their number. The next objects
which strike the eye on examining a freshly-gathered Pleurosigma
are numerous highly refractive oil-globules. These are not, however,
all in the same place, and one globule appears nearer
the observer than the other; their relative position is best seen
when a view of the narrow side of the frustule can be obtained,
so that one raphe is to the left and the other to the right. The
blue-black colour which is assumed by these globules after treating
with acid demonstrates their oleaginous nature. The middle of
the cavity of the frustule is occupied, in the larger navicula, by
two large oil-globules (seen in the diagrammatic <a href="#fig_295">Fig. 295</a>), and by a
colourless finely granular mass, whose position in the body is not so
clearly seen in the flat view as in the side view. Besides the central
mass, the conical cavities at either end of the frustule are seen to
enclose granular substance, and two linear extensions from each of
three masses are developed, closely underlying the raph&aelig;. In the side
view, therefore, they appear attached to the right and left edges of
the interior of the frustule. This colourless granular substance carries
in its centre, near the middle part of the diatom, an imperfectly
developed nucleus which is not very easy to see, but may be demonstrated
by the application of an acid. The colourless substance
is protoplasm, and encloses numerous small refractive particles; this,
on adding a drop of a one per cent. solution of osmic acid, is coloured
blue-black, and proves to be fat. It is, however, exceedingly difficult
to determine the exact limitations of the protoplasm, on account of
the highly refractive character of the silicious skeleton, and the
obstruction to the light presented by the endochrome.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span></p>

<p>At a short distance the protoplasm reappears, contracted into
a considerable mass, within the terminal ends of the frustule.
Schultze observed in this part of the protoplasm a rapid molecular
movement, “cyclosis,” such as occurs in Closterium, and also
a current of the granules of the protoplasm along the raphe.
“<i>Pleurosigma angulatum ‘crawls,’</i> as do all diatoms possessing
a raphe, along this line of suture. To crawl along, it must have
a fixed support.” “There is obviously,” adds Schultze, “but
one explanation; it is clear that there must be a band of
protoplasm lying along the raphe, which causes the particles of
colouring matter to adhere, and gives rise to a gliding movement.
For there is but one phenomenon which can be compared with the
gliding motion of foreign bodies on the Diatomace&aelig;, and that is,
the clinging to and casting off of particles by the pseudopodia of
the rhizopod, as observed, for instance, on placing a living Gromia
or Miliolina in still water with finely-powdered carmine. The nature
of the adhesion and of the motion is in both cases the same. And
since, with diatoms as unicellular organisms, protoplasm forms a
large part of the cell (in many cases two distinctly moving protoplasms),
this implies that the external movements are referable
to the movements of the protoplasm.” It is quite evident to
those who have studied the movements of diatoms that they are
surrounded by a sarcode structure of a more pellucid character than
that of Amœba. Six years before Schultze’s observations were
published, I wrote in a third edition of my book, page 307, “The
act of progression favours the notion of contractile tentacular
filaments&mdash;<i>pseudopodia</i>&mdash;as the organs of locomotion and prehension.”</p>

<p>Since my former observations on the movements of diatoms, I
have given much attention to two forms, <i>P. angulatum</i> and <i>Pinnularia</i>.
The powers used were Hartnack’s No. 8, and Gunlack’s
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub>-inch immersion; Gillett’s condenser illumination, with lamp flame
edge turned to mirror and bull’s-eye lens; a perforated slide with
a square of thin glass ·006 cemented to it, and a cover-glass of
·005. So far as I could satisfy myself, no terminal space, as in
the Closteria, could be seen, otherwise the course of the gemmules
is as freely traced as in that form. They are more minute than
the <i>Closterium lunula</i> granules, more steadily or slowly seen to
pass up and down one half the frustule towards the extremity,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
one half of the current seeming to turn round upon its axis and
descending towards the other. The granules were thickly scattered
at the apex, but gradually became fewer, and the ascending and
descending current tapered away towards the central nodule, which
became more filled up or closed in.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img id="fig_296" src="images/fig_296.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 296.&mdash;<i>Gomphonema constrictum.</i> (From a microphotograph.)</p></div>

<p>This beautiful sight was not confined to one frustule, but was
exhibited in all that were in a healthy condition. I examined several,
and watched them for a long time. The phenomenon described depends
much upon the healthy condition of the frustule at the time; as the
movements of the diatoms became sluggish, the circulation gradually
slackens and then ceases altogether. I also saw a somewhat similar
action in the more active specimens of <i>P. hippocampus</i> and <i>Navicula
cuspidata</i>, but the coarser markings and thickness of the wall of
these diatoms seemed to place greater difficulties in the way of
observation than the finer valves of the <i>P. angulatum</i>. One thing I
believe is certain, that the circulation described is precisely similar
to that seen in the Closteria, or, on a much larger scale, in Chara
and the leaf of the Anacharis, bearing in mind also that in the
Closterium the cell is divided by a transverse suture, and in <i>P.
angulatum</i> by a longitudinal one (<a href="#pl_ii">Plate II</a>., Nos. 38-40). About
the same time some very lively specimens of the Pinnulari&aelig; were
sent to me, and the movements of these frustules were more closely
observed. One or two of the more active would attack a body
relatively larger than itself, it would also force its way into a mass
of granular matter, and then recede from it with a jerky motion.
In more than one instance a cell of Palmogl&aelig;a was seized and
carried away by the Pinnularia, the former at the time being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
actively engaged in the process of cell division. Other diatoms
present among my specimens were also in an active condition, and
the circulation of granular matter in all was distinctly visible. In
the Pinnulari&aelig; two large colourless vesicles were seen on either side
of the median nodule, each having a central nucleus, as represented
in the accompanying sketch, made while under observation in two
positions. The central portion of each frustule was closely packed
with a rich yellowish-brown coloured endochrome, interspersed with
a few fat globules. The phenomenon of cyclosis was not seen in
any of these diatoms, but I have satisfied myself, by staining, of
the presence of a delicately fine external protoplasmic covering
in many diatoms. That their movements resemble the gliding
movements exhibited by the Amœba can scarcely be doubted.
Numerous forms of Diatomace&aelig; are found growing on or attached
to water-plants or pieces of detached stalks, which, although generally
simple, are sometimes compound, dividing and subdividing
in a beautiful ramous manner. Pinnulari&aelig;, Nitzschia, &amp;c., are
seen adherent by one extremity, about which they turn or bend
themselves as on a hinge. By the process of cell-division, groups
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
of Synedr&aelig; become attached by a point, in a fan-like form. The
fan-like collection of frustules is said to be flabellate, or radiate. In
Licmophora, Achnanthes and other species (<a href="#pl_ii">Plate II</a>., Nos. 29-33)
the double condition of union of frustules and of attachment by
a pedicle are illustrated. When a stipe branches it does so
normally in a dichotomous manner, each new individual being
produced by a secondary pedicle. This regular dichotomy is seen
in several genera: Cocconema and Gomphonema, the latter more
perfectly in <a href="#fig_296">Fig. 296</a>, from a microphotograph, in which a branching,
or rather longitudinal,
rupture of the pedicle
takes place at intervals,
and the entire organism
presents a more or less
complete flabella, or fan-like
cluster, on the summit
of the branches, and
imperfect or single frustules
irregularly scattered
throughout the whole
length of the pedicle.</p>

<p><i>Isthmia enervis</i> (Fig.
297).&mdash;The unicellular
frustule of this species
is extremely difficult to
define, owing to the large
areolations of the valves; it has a remarkable internal structure.
The olive-brown cell contents are found collected, for the most part,
into a central mass, from which radiating, branched, granular threads
extend to and unite with the periphery. When viewed by a magnifying
power of 600 or 700 diameters, these prolongations are seen
to be composed of aggregations of ovate or spindle-shaped corpuscles,
held together by protoplasmic matter. These bodies are sometimes
quiescent, but more often travel slowly to and fro from the central
mass. The general aspect under these conditions so nearly corresponds
to the characteristic circulation in the frustules of unicellular plants
and of certain rhizopoda, that it is difficult to realise that the object
when under examination is an elegant marine diatom.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_297" src="images/fig_297.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 297.&mdash;<i>Isthmia enervis.</i> Microphotograph.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span></p></div>

<p>There is a large section of diatoms in which the frustules are
diffused throughout a muco-gelatinous envelope in a definite manner.
Histologically this is homologous with the pedicles and connecting
nodules thrown out during the act of self-division, and in some
species (Cocconeis, Fragillaria, &amp;c.) it often persists after that act is
complete.</p>

<h3>Diatomace&aelig;, Recent and Fossil.</h3>

<p><i>Fossilised Diatomace&aelig;.</i>&mdash;Dr. Gregory was of opinion that a large
number of diatoms separated into species are only transition forms,
and more extended observations have proved that form and outline
are not always to be trusted in this matter. Species-making is
a modern invention, and can hardly apply to the indestructible
fossilised forms of the frustules of Diatomace&aelig;, with their beautiful
sculpturings and geometrical constructions, which have not been
materially changed since they were first deposited. Startling and
almost incredible as the assertion may appear to some, it is none the
less a fact established beyond all question, that some of the most
gigantic mountain-ranges, as the mighty Andes, towering into space
25,250 feet above the level of the sea, their base occupying vast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
areas of land; as also massive limestone rocks; the sand that covers
boundless deserts; and the soil of many wide-extended plains, are each
and all principally composed of Diatomace&aelig;. And, as Dr. Buckland
once observed: “The remains of such minute animals have added
much more to the mass of materials which compose the exterior
crust of the globe than the bones of elephants, hippopotami, and
whales.”</p>

<p>In 1841 the late Mr. Sollitt, of Hull, discovered the beautiful
longitudinal and transverse <i>stri&aelig;</i> (markings) on the <i>Pleurosigma
hippocampus</i>. A curved graceful line runs down the shell, in the
centre of which is an expanded oval opening. Near to the central
opening the dots elongate crossways, presenting the appearance of
small short bands.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of this town many interesting varieties of
Diatomace&aelig; have been found, the beauty of the varied forms of
which are constantly under investigation; at the same time
some of them are highly useful, as forming that class of <i>test objects</i>
which are better calculated than many others for determining the
excellence and powers of certain objectives. Mr. Sollitt carefully
measured the markings on some of the frustules and found they
ranged between the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>30000</sub>th and <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>130000</sub>th of an inch; the <i>Pleurosigma
strigilis</i> having the strongest markings, and the <i>Pleurosigma
acus</i> the finest.</p>

<p>Mr. J. D. Sollitt not only first proposed their use, but he also
furnished the measurements of the lines of the several members of
this family, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h3>Lichenace&aelig;.</h3>

<p>The lichens are a family of autonomous plants, an intermediary
group of algals or cellular cryptogams, drawing their nourishment
from the air through their whole surface medium, and propagating
by spores usually enclosed in asci, and always having green gonidia
in their thallus. Their gonidia, bright coloured globular cells, form
layers under the cortical covering of the thallus, and generally
develop in the form of incrustations, which cover stones, wood,
and the bark of trees, or penetrate into the lamell&aelig; of the epidermis
of woody plants. The gonidia of lichens partake of both the character
of vegetative and reproductive cells.</p>

<p>The thallus in the fructicose group attaches itself by a narrow
base, growing in the form of a miniature shrub. Another group
is met with in a slimy condition&mdash;the gelatinous lichens. These
species, for the most part, furnished dyes before the discovery of
the coal-tar dyes. In many of the <i>Palmella cruenta</i>, commonly
found growing on the walls and roofs of houses, a colourless acid
liquid is found, which, on being treated with alkali, produces a
bright yellow colour; and another, <i>Avernia vulpina</i>, furnishes a brown
dye; the <i>Rocella fuciformis</i> and <i>R. tinctoria</i> yield the purple dye
substance known as orchil, or archil, from which the useful blue
paper of the chemist for testing acidity is manufactured. Usnic
acid, combined with green and yellow resins, seems to be more or
less a constituent of many lichens.</p>

<p>A vertical section of <i>Palmella stellata</i> is given in <a href="#pl_i">Plate I</a>., No. 26,
in which the emission of the ripe spores of the lichens is seen to
be not unlike that which takes place in some of the fungi, Peziz&aelig;,
Sph&aelig;ri&aelig;, &amp;c. If a portion of the thallus be moistened and placed
in a common phial, with the apotheca turned toward one side, in
a few hours the opposite surface of the glass will be found covered
with patches of spores, easily perceptible by their colour; or if
placed on a moistened surface, and one of the usual glass slips
laid over it, the latter will be covered in a short time. As to the
powers of dissemination of these lowly organised plants, an observation
led to the conclusion that the gonidia of lichens have
greater powers in this direction than was formerly supposed.
It is found that by placing a clean sheet of glass in the open
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
air during a fall of snow, and receiving the melting water in
a tube or bottle, quantities of what has been looked upon as a
“unicellular plant” can be taken, the cells of which may be kept
in a dormant condition for a long time during cold weather, but
upon the return of spring warmth and moisture they begin to
increase, by a process of subdivision, into two, four or eight
portions; these soon assume a rounded form, and burst the parent
cell-wall open; these secondary cells then begin to divide and
subdivide again, and the process may go on without much variation
for a long time. The phenomena described may be watched by
taking a portion of the bark of a tree on which Chlorococcus
has been deposited, and placing it under a glass to keep it
in a moderately moist atmosphere; the only difference being a
change in colour, caused by the growth of the fibres, as may be
seen on microscopical examination. “And this,” says Dr. Hicks,
who first observed this phenomenon in plant life, “is an instructive
point, because it will be found that the colour varies
notably according to the lichen prevalent in its neighbourhood.”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
He believes there can be no doubt that what has been called
Chlorococcus is nothing more than the gonidia of a lichen; and
that under suitable conditions, chiefly drought and warmth, the
gonidium often throws out from its external envelope a small
fibre, which, adhering and branching, forms a “soridium.” “The
soridia remain dormant for a very long time, and do not develop
into thalli unless in a favourable situation, in some cases it may
be for years. It will be perceived that the soridium contains all
the elements of a thallus in miniature; in fact, a thallus does
frequently arise from one alone, and the fibres of neighbouring
soridia interlace; thus a thallus is matured very rapidly. This is
one of the causes of the variation of appearance so common in
many species of lichens, more readily seen towards the centre of
the parent thallus. When the gonidia remain attached to the
parent thallus, the circumstances are, of course, more favourable,
and they develop into secondary thalli, attached more or less to the
older one, which, in many instances, decays beneath them. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
process being continued year after year gives an apparent thickness
and spongy appearance to the lichen, and is the principal cause of
the various modifications in the external aspect of the lichens which
caused them formerly to be misunderstood and wrongly classified.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>The erratic lichens are found among the genus Palmella, some
of which grow among boulders of the primary and metamorphic
formations, curled up into a ball, and only fixed to their matrix
by a slender thread. The globular <i>Lecanora esculenta</i> will at
times suddenly cover large tracts of country in Persia and Tartary,
where it is eaten by the cattle. During a scarcity of food a shower
of these lichens, Mr. Berkeley tells us, fell at Erzeroum, and saved
the cattle from starvation.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>Another group of the Palmella, or Peltigeri, so named from the
target-like discs on their surface, spread their foliaceous fronds over
the ground, and as the fruit is marginal, it gives the thallus a
digitate appearance. These are often spotted over by a little red
fungus. The Lecidinei contains numerous species of the most varied
habits, and always crustaceous, and so closely adherent to the hard
rocks and stones on which they grow, that at length they disintegrate
them. From this low species a higher form arises, with
erect branching stems, and clothed with foliaceous, brightly-coloured
scales.</p>

<p>The Coccocarpei is mainly distinguished by having orbicular discs
entirely deprived of the cortical envelope called an excipulum. The
discs spring at once from the medullary stratum, and contain asci
and sporidia similar to those of the minute fungi Sph&aelig;ri&aelig;. Some
of the lichens are themselves parasitic, and begin existence under
the thick skin of the leaves of tropical plants, and spread encrusting
thallus over their surface, the excipulum and perithecia
being black; but in most cases these are beautifully sculptured,
and are interesting objects for the microscope. Indeed, the
sphere-bearing lichens, with upright stems bearing globular fruit
at the extremity of their branches, are at first indicated by a
swelling, but in time the outer layer bursts and exposes sporidia,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
which are beautiful objects under the microscope on account of their
spherical form and more or less deep blue tint. Humble and lowly
as lichens may appear to be, they have been divided into fifty-eight
or more genera and 2,500 species. The brothers Tulasne, De Bary,
the Rev. Mr. Berkeley, and others, devoted great attention to the
peculiarities of their structure and natural history.</p>

<p><i>Hepatic&aelig;.</i>&mdash;An intermediary group of much interest to the microscopist
are the Hepatic&aelig; (liverworts). These are found growing
on damp rocks in the neighbourhood of springs and dripping banks.
The scale-moss, the <i>Marchantia polymorphia</i> (<a href="#fig_299">Fig. 299</a>), may be
taken as typical of this little group, with its gemmiparous conceptacles
and lobed receptacles, bearing archegones on transparent
glass-like fruit stalks, carrying on their summits either round
shield-like discs or radiating bodies
with a striking resemblance to a wheel
without its tyre.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_299" src="images/fig_299.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 299.&mdash;<i>Marchantia polymorphia.</i></p></div>

<p>The liverworts are closely allied to
the mosses, and as much difficulty
was experienced in dividing the two,
Hooker placed the whole under one
genus, the Jungermannia. More recently,
however, they have been
divided into those with a stem and leaves confluent in a frond,
Marchantia; those with stem and leaves distinct, Jungermannia;
and those with a solitary capsule, filiform, bivalved, stalked, with a
free central placentation, Anthocotace&aelig;. Some botanists have further
divided them, but they are all extensively propagated by gemm&aelig;.</p>

<p>The fronds carry the male organs, or <i>antherids</i>, and the disc, in
the first instance, bears the female organs, or <i>archegones</i>, and after
a time gives place to the <i>sporanges</i>, or spore cases. It is these
bodies which are of so much interest to microscopists; if the
plant is brought into a warm room, they suddenly burst open with
some violence the moment a drop of water is applied to them, and
the sporanges are dispersed in a small cloud of brownish dust. If
this dust is examined under a medium power, it is seen to consist
of a number of chain-like bodies, somewhat like the spring of a
small watch; and if the process of bursting be closely watched,
these minute springs will be found twisting and curling about in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
every direction. The structure of the frond itself will be seen
to be interesting when cut in the vertical direction and placed
under the microscope.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_300" src="images/fig_300.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="hang">Fig. 300.&mdash;Gemmiparous conceptacle
of <i>Marchantia polymorphia</i>,
expanding and rising from the
surface of a frond. In the interior
are seen gopidial gemm&aelig; already
detached by the splitting of the
epiderm.</p></div>

<p>The gemm&aelig; of <i>Marchantia polymorphia</i> are produced in elegant
membranous cups, with a toothed margin growing on the upper
surface of the frond, especially in very damp courtyards between
the stones, or near running water, where its lobed fronds are found
covering extensive tracts of moist soil. At the period of fructification
the fronds send up stalks, which carry at their summit
round shield-like radiating discs,
which bear upon their surface a
number of little open basket-shaped
“conceptacles.” These again expand
into singularly graceful cups (as in
<a href="#fig_300">Fig. 300</a>), and are found in all stages
of development. When mature, the
basket contains a number of little
green round or oblong discs, each
composed of two or more layers of
cells; the wall itself being surmounted
by a glistening fringe of
teeth, whose edges are themselves
regularly fringed with minute outgrowths.
The cup seems to be
formed by a development of the superior epidermis, which is raised
up, and finally bursts and spreads out, laying bare the seeds.</p>

<p>The archegones of Marchantia are very curious bodies, while the
elater and spores are even still more so. These are elongated cells,
each containing a double spiral fibre coiled up in the interior. It is
the elasticity of this which tears apart the cell-membrane, and sends
forth the spores with a jerk, and thus assists in their dispersion.
Marchantia is the type of the malloid Hepatic&aelig;.</p>

<h3>Musci, Bryophyta.</h3>

<p>Mosses are a beautiful class of non-vascular cryptogams. Linn&aelig;us
called them <i>servi</i>, servants or workmen, as they seem to labour to
produce vegetation in places where soil is not already formed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
The Bryophyta form three natural divisions: the Bryin&aelig;, or true
mosses; the Sphagnace&aelig;, or peat-mosses; and the Hepatic&aelig;, or liverworts.
The two first are commonly united. In these the sexual
organs consist of antheridia and archegonia, but they are of simpler
structure than will be
found in ferns; and the
first generation from the
spore is asexual.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_301" src="images/fig_301.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 301.&mdash;Screw-moss.</p></div>

<p>The common or wall
screw-moss (<a href="#fig_301">Fig. 301</a>)
grows almost everywhere,
and if examined closely,
is seen to have springing
from its base numerous
very slender stems, each terminating in a dark brown case, which
encloses antheroids. If a patch of the moss is gathered when in
this state, and the green part of the base is put into water, the
threads of the fringe will uncoil and disentangle themselves in a most
curious and beautiful manner; from this circumstance
the plant takes its popular name of screw-moss.
The leaf usually consists of either a single
or a double layer of cells, having flattened sides,
by which they adhere one to another. The leaf-cells
(<a href="#fig_302">Fig. 302</a>) of the Sphagnum or bog-moss
exhibit a curious departure from the ordinary
type; they are large, polygonal, and elongated,
and contain spiral fibres loosely coiled in their
interior. The young leaf does not differ from the
older; both are evolved by a gradual process of
differentiation.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p class="hang">Fig. 302.&mdash;Section
of leaf of Sphagnum
moss, showing

spiral fibres and
connecting apertures.</p></div>

<p>Mosses, like liverworts, possess both antheridia
and pistillida, which are engaged in the process
of fructification. The fertilized cell becomes gradually developed
into a conical body elevated upon a footstalk, the walls of the flask-shaped
body carrying the higher part upwards as a <i>calyptra</i> or hood
upon its summit, while the lower part remains to form a kind of
collar round the base. These spore-capsules are closed on their
summit by <i>opercula</i> or lids, and their mouths when laid open are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
surrounded by a beautiful toothed fringe, termed the <i>peristome</i>. This
fringe is shown in <a href="#fig_303">Fig. 303</a>, in the centre of a capsule of Funaria,
with its peristome <i>in situ</i>. The fringes of teeth are variously constructed,
and are of great service in discriminating the genera. In
<i>Neckera antipyretica</i> the peristome is double, the inner being composed
of teeth united by cross bars, forming
a very pretty trellis. The seed spores
are contained in the upper part of
the capsule, where they are clustered
round the central pillar, termed the
<i>columella</i>; and at the time of maturity,
the interior of the capsule is almost
entirely occupied by spores.</p>

<img id="fig_304" src="images/fig_304.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 304.&mdash;Hair-moss in Fruit.</p></div></div>

<p>The undulating hair-moss, <i>Polytrichum undulatum</i> (<a href="#fig_304">Fig. 304</a>), is
found on moist, shady banks of pools and rivulets. The seed-vessel
has a curious shaggy cap; but in its construction it is very similar
to that of the screw-moss, except that the fringe around its opening
is not twisted. The reproductive organs of mosses are of two kinds;
the capsule containing minute spores, <i>archegonia</i>, and the <i>antheridia</i>,
or male efflorescence. The capsule, <i>theca</i>, or sporangium, is lateral
or terminal, sessile, or on a fruit stalk (<i>seta</i>) of various shapes,
indehiscent, or bursting by four valves at the sides, or more commonly
by a deciduous cup, <i>operculum</i>. When this falls the mouth of the
capsule becomes exposed. The rim is crowned with tooth-like or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
cilia-like appendages in sets of four or multiples of that number&mdash;<i>peristome</i>.
These are often brightly coloured and hydroscopic. By
simply breathing upon them they suddenly fly open, and are
endowed with motion, that is, if they contain spores. The spores on
germination produce a green confervoid-like mass of threads, from
which the young plant arises.</p>

<p>The Sphagnace&aelig;, or “bog mosses,” have been separated from true
mosses from the marked differences they present. The stem is more
widely differentiated, and throughout its structure a rapid passage of
fluid takes place. It has the power of absorbing moisture from the
atmosphere, so that if a plant be placed dry in a glass of water with
its rosette of leaves hanging over the edge, it acts like a syphon, and
the water will drop from it until the glass is emptied. As may be
supposed, the leaf is composed of large open cells, and it absorbs more
water than the root. The antherids or male organs of Sphagnace&aelig;
resemble those of liverworts, rather than those of mosses, both in form
and arrangement; they are grouped in “catkins” at the tips of the
lateral branches, each of the imbricated perigonal leaves enclosing
a single globose antherid on a slender foot-stalk, and surrounded
by long branched paraphyses of cobweb-like tenuity. The female
organs, or archegones, do not differ materially in structure from
those of mosses; they are grouped together in a sheath of deep
green leaves at the end of the shorter lateral branchlets at the side
of the rosette or terminal crown of leaves. The sporange is very
uniform in all the species, and the spores are in groups of fours, as
in mosses, around a hemispherical columella. These plants grow so
rapidly that they soon cover a pool with thin matted bundles of
branches, and as they decay they fall to the bottom, and become the
foundation of the future bog or peat moss.</p>

<p><b>Felices.</b>&mdash;Of all the spore-bearing families the ferns are the
more universally known. They constitute an exceedingly numerous
genera and species, and vary from low herbaceous plants of an inch
in height to that of tree ferns, which attain a height of fifty or
more feet, terminating in a graceful coronet of fronds or leaves.
Of whatever size a fern may be, its spores are, for the most part,
microscopic, produced within the sporangium by cell division, and
are therefore free and variously shaped.</p>

<p>The true mode of development of ferns from their spores was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
that furnished by N&auml;geli, who announced the existence of antheridia.
On the spore starting into life it sends out from the cell-wall of its
outer coat a white tubular projection, or root fibre (<a href="#fig_305">Fig. 305</a>, <small>A</small>, <small>B</small>,
and <small>C</small>), which passes through the cell-wall of its outer coat. This
attracts sufficient moisture to burst open the outer, and then it
begins to increase by the subdivision of its cells, until the primary
green prothallus <small>D</small> is formed. This falls to the ground, and, being
furnished on its under side with thread-like fibres, fixes itself to the
earth, and thus is developed the rhizome, or root of the future plant.
In each of the antheridia, which are numerous, a cell is formed,
chiefly filled with albuminous matter and free spores, each having
attached a flat ribbon-like filament, or stermatoid, curled in a spiral
manner. These are ultimately set free by the rupture of the cell-wall,
and commence revolving rapidly by the agency of the whip-like
appendage at the larger end.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_305" src="images/fig_305.jpg" alt="" />

<p>The sporangia, or spore-cases, are, for the most part, globular in
form, and are nearly or quite surrounded by a strong elastic ring,
which in some cases is continued to form a stalk. When the spores
are ripe, this ring, by its elastic force, tears open the sporangia and
gives exit to a quantity of microscopic filaments, curled in corkscrew-like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
fashion (Figs. 305 and 307). The ring assumes various forms;
in one group it passes vertically up the back of the sporangium,
and is continued to a point termed the stomata, where the horizontal
bursting takes place. This form
is seen in <a href="#fig_306">Fig. 306</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>. In other
groups it is vertical, as in <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>;
in others transverse, as in <i>d</i>; or
apical, as at <i>e</i>; and in a few
instances it is obsolete, as in <i>f</i>.
These are the true ferns, and their
systematic arrangement is chiefly
founded on the peculiarity of the
sori and sporangia, characters which
become quite intelligible by the aid
of the microscope.</p>

<p>The beautiful ringed sporangium
of the fern (<a href="#fig_307">Fig. 307</a>) when ruptured
gives exit to the dust-like
spores; these, examined under a
moderate power, are seen to be sub-globose and pyramidal, the outer
coat or exospore being a coloured hyaline cell with nuclei similar to
the spores of mosses, but in which
chlorophyll soon begins to form, and
from this little green embryonic growth
the organs of reproduction are formed.</p>

<p>In all ferns the pistillidia or archegonia
are analogous to the ovules or
nascent seeds of flowering plants, and
contain, like them, a germinal vesicle,
which becomes fertilized through the
agency of the spiral filaments, and then
gradually develops into an embryo plant
possessing a terminal bud. This bud
begins at once to unfold and push out leaves with a circinate
vernation, of a very simple form at first, and growing up beneath
the prothallium, coming out at the notch; single fibrous roots are
at the same time sent down into the earth, the delicate expanded
prothallium withers away, and the foundation of the perfect fern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
plant is laid. When a fern acquires a considerable stem, as in a
tree fern, it consists of cellular tissue and an external cortical
portion forming fibro-vascular bundles, scalariform ducts, and woody
fibre. <a href="#fig_308">Fig. 308</a>, <i>b</i>, shows an oblique section of the footstalk of a fern
leaf with its bundle of scalariform ducts.</p>

<p>These observations on ferns have acquired increased interest from
subsequent investigations made on the allied Cryptogams, and on
the processes occurring in the impregnation of the Conifers. Not
only have later researches furnished a satisfactory interpretation of
the archegonia and antheridia of the mosses and liverworts, but
they have made known and co-ordinated the existence of analogous
phenomena in the Equisetace&aelig;, Lycopodiace&aelig;, and Rhizocarpe&aelig;, and
prove, moreover, that the bodies described by Dr. Brown in the
Conifers under the name of “corpuscles” are analogous to the
<i>archegonia</i> of the Cryptogams; so that a link is hereby formed
between these groups and the higher flowering plants.</p>

<p><i>Equisetace&aelig;.</i>&mdash;The development of <i>Horse-tails</i> (<a href="#fig_309">Fig. 309</a>), the
name by which they are commonly known, corresponds in some
respects with that of ferns. They comprise a little group, and the
whole of their structure is composed in an extraordinary degree by
silex, so that even when the organic portion has been destroyed by
prolonged maceration in strong acid, a consistent skeleton still
remains. It is this flinty material that constitutes their chief
interest for microscopists. A portion of their silicious particles is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
distributed in two lines, arranged parallel to the axis of the plant,
others are grouped into oval forms, and connected by a chain as in
a necklace. The form and arrangement of the crystals are better
seen under polarised light. <a href="#pl_viii">Plate VIII</a>., No. 170, a portion of the
epidermis, forms an extremely beautiful object. Sir David Brewster
pointed out that each silicious particle has a regular axis of double
refraction. What is usually said to be the fructification of the
Equisetace&aelig; forms a cone or spike-like extremity to the top of the
stem (<a href="#fig_309">Fig. 309</a>), the whole resembling a series of spike-like branches
(the real stem being a horizontal rhizome), and a cluster of shield-like
discs, each of which carries a circle of sporanges that open by
longitudinal slits to set free the spores which are attached to it in
two pairs of elastic filaments (shown in <a href="#fig_291">Fig. 291</a>, <small>F</small>, <small>G</small>), <i>elaters</i>; these are
at first coiled up around the spore in the manner represented at <small>G</small>,
but on their liberation they extend themselves as shown at <small>F</small>. The
slightest moisture will close them up again, and their purpose
having been served in the distribution of the spores, they are no
longer required. If a number of spores be spread out on a glass-slip
under the microscope and, while watching, a bystander breathes
upon them, they immediately respond, are set in motion, presenting
a curious appearance, but as soon as the hydroscopic effect has
passed off they return to their previous condition. These spores
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
can be mounted in a cell with a movable cover, and made to exhibit
the same effect over and over again.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>The vascular tissue of the Equisetace&aelig; (<a href="#fig_309">Fig. 309</a>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>) shows them
to be of a higher grade than the ferns. More recently discovered
Horse-tails, of Brazil, grow to a gigantic size, but even these are
comparatively small when compared with the Calamites, and other
fossil Equisetace&aelig; of the coal measures and new red sandstone.
They all require a calcareous flinty soil for growth. A spring water-course
making its way to the sea, as in the Chines of the Isle of
Wight, is very favourable, the author having gathered them more
than once in Bramble Chine.</p>

<p>Nearly allied to ferns is a little group of small aquatic plants,
the Rhizocarpe&aelig; (pepperworts), which either float on the water or
creep along shallow bottoms. These are chiefly curious from having
two kinds of spores produced from separate sporanges; smaller and
larger “microspores” undergoing progressive sub-division without the
formation of a distinct prothallium; each cell giving origin to an
antherozoid, a generative process said to belong exclusively to flowering
plants, corresponding indeed to the pollen grains of higher plants.</p>

<h3>Structure of Phanerogami&aelig; or Flowering Plants.</h3>

<p>The two great divisions of the vegetable kingdom are known as
Cryptogamia and Phanerogamia. It does not follow, however, that
there is any abrupt break between the two, as will appear from
the context. Although it is customary to speak of the flowering
plants as a higher grade of life, yet there is an intermediary class of
Phanerogami&aelig; in which the conspicuous parts of the generative
system partake of a condition closely resembling those of the higher
Cryptogami&aelig;, observed in Gymnosperms, Conifer&aelig;, and Cycad&aelig;.
So it may be said the distinctive character of the former is that of
reproduction by seeds rather than flowers. The progress of botanical
science during the latter half of the Victorian reign has been quite
as remarkable as that of histology; while the comparative physiology
and morphology of plants have perhaps advanced even more
rapidly because the ground was newer. The consequence is that
the specialisation of botanical science has been brought about con-currently
with a more comprehensive nomenclature. The chief cause
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
in this instance of modern specialisation is utility. “If we look at
the great groups of plants from a broad point of view, it will be seen
that the fungi and the phanerogams occupy public attention on
other grounds than do the alg&aelig;, mosses and ferns. Alg&aelig; are
especially a physiologist’s group, employed in questions on nutrition,
reproduction, and cell division and growth. The Bryophyta and
Pteridophyta, are, on the other hand, the domain of the morphologist
concerned with such questions as the alternations of generations
and the evolution of the higher plants.</p>

<p>“Fungi and phanerogams, while equally or even more employed by
specialists in morphology and physiology, appeal widely to general
interest, and evidently so on the ground of utility. Without saying
that this enhances the importance of either group, it certainly attracts
scientific attention to them. However, the histology of the minute
cell, in addition to its importance from an academical point of view,
has a special interest for the microscopist.”</p>

<p>It would be impossible to find anything more remarkable in
histology than the detailed agreement in the structure and behaviour
of the nucleus in the higher plants and the higher animals, an agreement
which is conspicuously manifest in those special divisions which
take place during the maturation of the sexual cells.</p>

<p>So with regard to the question of “alternation of generations.”
We have known since the important discoveries of Hofmeister
that the development of a large part of the vegetable kingdom
involves a regular alternation of two distinct generations, the one
which is sexual being constantly succeeded, so far as the normal
cycle is concerned, by the other which is asexual. This alternation
is most marked in the mosses and ferns. In the Bryophyta the
ordinary moss or liverwort plant is the sexual generation of the
ovum, which, when fertilised, gives rise to the moss-fruit, and
represents the asexual stage. The latter is once more seen to form
spores from which the sexual plant is again developed.</p>

<p>In the Pteridophyta the alternation is equally regular, but the
relative development of the two generations is totally different, the
sexual form being the insignificant prothallus, while the whole fern-plant,
as we ordinarily know it, is the asexual generation.</p>

<p>The thallus of some of the lower Bryophyta is quite comparable
with the prothallus of a fern, so as regards the sexual generation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
there is no difficulty in seeing the relation of the two classes; but
when we come to the asexual generation or sporophyte the case is
totally different. There is no appreciable resemblance between the
fruit of any of the Bryophyta and the plant of any vascular
Cryptogam.</p>

<p>“It is now known that in the higher plants a remarkable numerical
change takes place in the constituents of the nucleus of the cell
shortly before fertilisation. In angiospermous plants a reduction of
the chromosomes occurs shortly before differentiation of the sexual
cells. Thus, in the case of the lily, fertilisation is not the simple
fusion of nuclear bodies. These spheres are seen to fuse in pairs,
and then by position to determine the plane of first cleavage of the
ovum; agreeing, in fact, closely with what is observed to take place
in the animal kingdom.”</p>

<p>In the higher grades of plants it will be evident that the several
tissues that compose their bodies are not found in the root, stem, and
leaf without definite order and purpose, but that they are grouped
into systems for the performance of different kinds of work. In all
flowering plants at least three different systems may be clearly distinguished.
These are the epidermal or boundary tissue system, the
fundamental or ground tissue system, and the fibro-vascular or conducting
system. All three systems of tissue originate from meristem
cells, located at the growing point of the stem and root.</p>

<p>Although these systems characterise the higher types of plants,
the elementary tissues (represented in <a href="#pl_xiii">Plate XIII</a>. and in other
figures) enter alike into the several component parts of nearly all
plants. The stem, the branch, and the root, are alike constituted
of an outer coating which affords a mechanical support, and once
formed takes no further share in the economy of the plant, excepting
that of assisting to convey fluid from the roots to the branches and
leaves, an action more of a capillary nature than vital. The nourishment
of the plant is brought about by other material structures, as
the pith, the cortex, the cambium, and so forth, all of which greatly
assist in the formative process. The woody portion of the plants is
especially concerned in furnishing support to the softer pulpy textures,
while the tissues of leaves and flowers are chiefly composed
of cells compactly held together by protoplasmic or albuminoid
matter. Water, of course, enters largely into the constituents of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
all plants. Beneath the epidermis is another layer of importance,
the parenchymatous, which becomes more or less solid with the
growth of the pith and cellular wall. In the pulpy substance of
some leaves the epidermis presents a thin lamina of palisade-tissue,
the bulk of the mesophyll consisting of spongy parenchyma or
sclerenchymatous fibres (seen in <a href="#fig_310">Fig. 310</a>), which also serve to show
the disposition of the several layers about to be brought under
notice.</p>

<p><i>Development of the Tissue Systems.</i>&mdash;In the growing plant the
embryonic cells soon become differentiated into three primary meristem
layers, known as dermatogen, periblem, and phloem, from which
are developed respectively the primary cortex, epidermis, and
the stele or vascular cylinder. The dermatogen forms the outermost
layer of cells at the growing point, and when present always
develops into true epidermal tissue. In stems the dermatogen is
always single-layered, while in roots it consists of several layers and
develops a many-layered epidermis.</p>

<p>The periblem occurs immediately beneath the dermatogen, forming
a hollow cylinder of tissue, which surrounds the phloem. From the
periblem is developed the fundamental tissue of the primary cortex.
When no dermatogen is present in the growing-point (stems of
vascular cryptogams) the external layer of the periblem develops
cells which perform epidermal functions. The phloem occupies
the centre of the growing-point, and consists of a solid mass of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
somewhat elongated cells. From the phloem are developed the
fibro-vascular and fundamental tissues of the vascular-cylinder or
stele.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption">PLATE XIII.</p>
<img id="pl_xiii" src="images/pl_xiii.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="caption">ELEMENTARY PLANT TISSUES.</p></div>

<p><i>Epidermal or Boundary Tissue System.</i>&mdash;This system constitutes
the external covering of the plant, and is commonly called the
epidermis. It includes, besides the ordinary epidermal cells, the
guard-cells of the stomata and water pores, the plant hairs or
trichomes, and the epidermal or external glands. The epidermal
tissues are chiefly protective in function, serving to prevent excessive
evaporation from the interior tissues of the plant.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_311" src="images/fig_311.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 311.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Epidermis, reticulated ducts, and conjunctive palisade cells; <i>b.</i> Vertical
section of alder root, woody layer, and boundary ducts.</p></div>

<p>In stems the external layer of cells, whatever its origin, is known
as the epidermis, while in roots it is called the epiblema. The
epidermis usually consists of a single layer of cells, but in some cases
it is two or three-layered, as in the leaves of figs and begonias.</p>

<p>In land plants the epidermis is usually strongly cutinised, while
in submerged plants it is never cutinised. The epidermis of land
plants is also often waxy, the wax occurring on the surface as minute
grains, rods or flakes, constituting the so-called bloom of leaves and
fruits, and giving to them their glaucous appearance. Chlorophyll
bodies are usually absent from the ordinary epidermal cells of land
plants, while they commonly occur in the epidermal cells of aquatic
plants.</p>

<p>Ordinary epidermal cells are usually thin-walled and transparent,
and contain a nucleus and colourless watery protoplasm, but are
destitute of both chlorophyll-bodies and starch-grains.</p>

<p>The external layers of the outer walls constitute the cuticle of
the plant, while the internal layers and the radial and inner walls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
are composed of cellulose. The cells of the epidermis are always
very compactly arranged, having their walls so closely adherent that
the intercellular spaces are entirely obliterated except at the stomata
and water-pores.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_312" src="images/fig_312.jpg" alt="" />

or openings in the parenchyma corresponding to the stomata.</p></div>

<p>There are exceptions to this rule, as, for example, in <i>Cinchona
calisaya</i>, which shows no trace of epidermis, this being replaced by
a corky layer of tubular cells. Where this occurs in a plant to any
extent, the whole of the outer tissues are displaced, and the bark
consists exclusively of phloem tissues. This, although of constant
occurrence in <i>C. calisaya</i>, is not so common in other species, as <i>C.
succirubia</i>, the middle structure of which consists of parenchyma in
which appear more or less numerous isolated store-cells, and when
these are absent there is a formation of rhytidoma and displacement
of the tissues containing the store-cells and ducts. The chlorophyll
of <i>C. succirubia</i> is very marked, and its spectrum presents seven
distinct absorption bands.</p>

<p>The epidermal system of plants in general includes other tissues
than those already named, as the guard-cells of the stomata, the
water-pores, plant-hairs or trichomes, and the external or epidermal
glands, all of which are but modifications of ordinary epidermal tissue.</p>

<p><i>The Stomata or Breathing Pores</i> are apertures in the epidermal which
lie over large intercellular spaces (Fig 312, 2, <i>b</i>). These are usually
bordered by two modified epidermal cells, called guard-cells. Stomata
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
are formed in the following manner: A young epidermal cell divides
into two equal portions by the formation of a septum across its
middle, each half developing into a guard-cell; the septum now splits
lengthwise and separates the guard-cells, leaving an aperture or
stoma between them.</p>

<p>In the higher plants the guard-cells of the stomata are crescent-shaped
and occur in pairs, the concave sides of the cells facing each
other with the aperture between, while in mosses the stomata possesses
but a single annular guard-cell which surrounds the aperture. The
guard-cells of stomata usually contain chlorophyll-bodies in addition
to the ordinary protoplasm. They have the power of increasing or
diminishing the size of the aperture under the influence of light and
moisture, thus regulating the amount of evaporation from the internal
tissues of the plant.</p>

<p><i>Water Pores or Water Stomata</i> are apertures in the epidermis,
similar in structure to ordinary stomata, but differ from them both in
function and distribution. Water-pores excrete water in the form of
drops, and have their guard-cells fixed and immovable. They always
occur at the ends of vasal bundles, and are found on the margin and
at the apex of leaves.</p>

<p><i>Plant Hairs or Trichomes</i> are modified epidermal cells prolonged
externally, and may be either unicellular or multicellular. Each hair
consists of a basal portion, or foot, which is embedded among the
ordinary epidermal cells, and an apical portion or body, which is
prolonged externally. Ordinary epidermal hairs are usually thin-walled,
the inner layers of the wall being composed of cellulose,
while the outer layer is more or less strongly cutinised. The walls
may become hardened by deposits of lime-salts or silica. Sometimes
the cells become glandular and secrete oily, resinous, or irritating
matters, as in stinging-nettle hairs (<a href="#pl_xiii">Plate XIII</a>., No. 19), when they
are known as glandular hairs. The development of resin-passages
may be observed in transverse sections of the stem of the ivy
(<i>Hedera helix</i>) cut from a young succulent stem, and mounted in
glycerine. The resin is seen scattered through the cortex and pith,
and in the soft bast which lies outside the cambium in various stages
of development, starting from a group of four cells without intercellular
spaces.</p>

<p>Root hairs spring from the epiblema and are never cutinised, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
are frequently more or less mucilaginous. The root-hairs are the
principal absorbing organs of the plant, and are confined to the
younger roots, occurring just above their tips. Root-hairs are never
present in aquatic plants, and are absent from the roots of certain of
the Conifer&aelig;. It is a curious fact with regard to bell-heather growing
in higher latitudes, that the plants possess a peculiar root structure
as a protection against droughts. In most of them the sustentation
of life depends upon the formation of a number of long thin filaments
on their roots resembling root-hairs, which penetrate the root, forming
nodular masses within it. These filaments belong to a fungus entirely
parasitic to the root, and yet different from a common parasite, inasmuch
as the plant in this way obtains so much of its nourishment,
and when the fungus is not present, or is removed, the plant can no
longer live on a peaty soil. The leaf-blade of the coarse moorland
grass Nardus is likewise endowed with a singular property&mdash;that of
rolling up cylindrically and spreading out again to adapt itself to
the dry and wet weather of the moorlands of Scotland.</p>

colouring matter; <i>b.</i> Section of stem of Clematis, three pores separated and
more highly magnified; <i>c.</i> Transverse section of same, showing medullary rays.</p></div>

<p><i>Fundamental or Ground Tissue System.</i>&mdash;This system constitutes
the groundwork of plants, and is the system through which the
vasal bundles are distributed. The fundamental tissues are composed
largely, though not wholly, of parenchyma, and are chiefly
concerned in the metabolic work of plant life.</p>

<p>Ground tissue includes, besides ordinary parenchyma, collenchyma,
selerenchymatous parenchyma, fibrous tissue, cork, laticiferous and
glandular tissues. To the fundamental system also belongs the
chlorophyll cells of leaves, the thin-walled cells of the pith and
medullary rays, the cells of the cortex of stems and roots, and most
of the soft cellular tissues in all plants.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span></p>

<p>The lower plants consist almost entirely of fundamental tissue.
In the herbaceous forms of the higher plants the ground tissues
largely predominate, while in woody plants they are present in
much smaller proportion, the vascular tissues being the most
abundant. In aquatic plants generally, the fundamental tissues
constitute the principal system.</p>

<p>The hypoderma occurs immediately beneath the epidermis, and
consists of several layers of cells. A collenchymatous hypoderma
is found in the stems and petioles of most herbaceous dicotyls, and
frequently occurs next the mid-rib of leaves, where it forms a
strengthening tissue. A sclerenchymatous hypoderma occurs either
as a continuous layer beneath the epidermis, as in the stems of
some ferns, <i>Pteris aquilina</i>, and in leaves of the pine; or it may form
numerous isolated strands beneath the epidermis, as in the stems of
horsetails and in certain Umbellifer&aelig;.</p>

<i>b.</i> Vertical section of same, spiral fibres, and ducts; <i>c.</i> Vertical section of
Elm, showing ducts and dotted cells.</p></div>

<p>The endodermis is the innermost layer of the extra-stelar fundamental
tissues, and always abuts on the stele or steles. In monocotyls
it marks the boundary between the cortex and the central
cylinder, and it is sometimes spoken of as the nucleus sheath.</p>

<p>In stems the endodermal cells are usually thin-walled and unlignified,
having a suberous thickening band extending round the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
upper, lower and lateral surfaces, which in cross-section appears as a
black dot on the radial wall (<a href="#fig_314">Fig. 314</a>, <i>c</i>.)</p>

<p>According to its position in the stele, the conjunctive tissue is
divided into three principal portions, viz., that portion which invests
the vasal bundles, the pericycle; that portion which lies between
the bundles of the stele, the interfascicular conjunctive tissue; and
that which occupies the centre of the stele, the medullary conjunctive
tissue. The pericycle, formerly called the pericambium, is the outermost
layer of the conjunctive tissue of the stele.</p>

<p>The bundle-sheath of the young stem is more easily recognised
than in the older stem. It is, in fact, a continuous layer of cells,
whose radial walls have a characteristic dark spot on each radial wall.
The bundle-sheath lies immediately outside the vascular bundles,
curving slightly towards the centre of the stem in the spaces
between the bundles. It is more prominent in the stem when very
young, as the cells are then filled with starch granules. This layer
of cells will be readily seen in sections treated with iodine.</p>

<p>In dicotyls and gymnosperms the medullary rays consist essentially
of interfascicular ground tissue. The medullary conjunctive
tissue occupies the centre of the stele, constituting the so-called
pith, and usually consists of parenchymatous cells, but may contain,
in addition, either stone cells, sclerenchyma fibres, laticiferous or
glandular tissues.</p>

<p><i>The Fibro-vascular or Conducting Tissue System.</i>&mdash;This system
constitutes the fibrous framework of the plant, and is the system
by means of which fluids are conducted from one part of the plant
to another. Its function is partly to give strength and support, but
principally to conduct the crude and elaborated juices to and from
the leaves. It is found only in the higher plants, constituting the
tough and stringy tissues in stems and roots, and the system of
veins in leaves. The fibro-vascular system consists essentially of
vascular tissue (ducts, tracheids, and sieve-tubes), and forms long
strands&mdash;the fibro-vascular bundles&mdash;which extend vertically through
the fundamental tissues of the plant. The term “fibro-vascular,”
as applied to the conducting system, is not strictly correct, since
fibres do not always accompany the vascular elements, hence this
system is often spoken of as the vascular system, and the bundles
as vascular, or more briefly as vasal bundles.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span></p>

<p>That the arrangement, and course of the vascular bundles in
dicotyledous stems are connected with those of the leaves is an
obvious fact. It may be seen in sections of Helianthus, but is
more markedly shown in plants with regularly decussate leaves, as
Cerastium, Clematis, &amp;c. Still, the arrangement of the bundles may
differ radically from that of the leaves, and is, to a certain extent,
independent of them. This will be noticed in sections of <i>Iberis
amara</i>, where the bundles do not run longitudinally, but in
tangential spirals. These, as N&auml;geli pointed out, have no direct
relation with the leaves; and he recommends a series of types for
investigation, in which it will be seen how closely the arrangement
of the bundles is connected with the arrangement of the leaves, and
the number of bundles entering the stem from each leaf: <i>Iberis
amara</i>, leaves alternate, leaf-trace with one bundle; Lupinus, leaves
alternate, leaf-trace with three bundles; Cerastium, leaves opposite,
leaf-trace with one bundle; Clematis, leaves opposite, leaf-trace with
three bundles; Stachys, leaves opposite, leaf-trace with two bundles.</p>

of stem of Conifer, the phloem and zones of annual growth; 3. Section of an
Ivory Nut, cells, and radiating pores; 4. Section of the outer or ligneous
portion of same, with radiating cells.</p></div>

<p>The connection of the leaf and stem will be best seen by cutting
longitudinal sections through a <i>young node</i> of Helianthus, so as to
include the median plane of the leaf, or of both leaves if opposite
to each other, as they often are; steep them in dilute potash for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
twenty-four hours and mount in glycerine. A medium power will
serve for their examination. The course of the vascular bundles
will appear dark through the more transparent parenchyma. The
continuity of the tissues of the stem and petiole if followed will be
seen to have no definite boundary between the two parts; the bundles
from the petiole pass into the stem, and no bundle of the upper
internode lies in the same vertical plane as that which enters from
the petiole between two successive bundles of the vascular ring.</p>

<p>Every complete <i>vasal bundle</i> consists of xylem or wood and phloem
or bast.</p>

<p>The former consists essentially of trachery tissue (ducts and
tracheids), and may contain in addition both wood fibres and wood
parenchyma. The phloem or bast consists essentially of sieve tissue,
and usually contains some ordinary parenchyma. In angiosperms
companion-cells always accompany the sieve-tubes in the phloem,
while in gymnosperms they are absent.</p>

<p>According to the relative positions of the xylem and phloem
elements, there are two principal kinds of conjoint bundles&mdash;the
collateral and the concentric. Of these again there are three varieties,
but the experiments with leaves bring out parallel facts; that in
ordinary stems the staining of the wood by an ascending coloured
liquid is due, not to the passage of the coloured liquid up the
substance of the wood, but to the permeability of its ducts and such
of its pitted cells as are united into regular canals; and the facts
showing this at the same time indicate with tolerable clearness
the process by which wood is formed, for what in these cases is
seen to take place with dye may be fairly presumed to take place
with sap.</p>

<p>Taking it, then, as a fact that the vessels and ducts are the channels
through which the sap is distributed, the varying permeability of
their walls, and consequent formation of wood, is due to the exposure
of the plant to intermittent mechanical strains, actual or potential,
or both, in this way. If a trunk, a bough, shoot, or a petiole is
bent by a gust of wind, the substance of its convex side is subject to
longitudinal tension, the substance of its concave side being at the
same time compressed. This is the primary mechanical effect. The
secondary is when the tissues of the convex side are stretched,
and also produce lateral compression. In short, the formation of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
wood is dependent upon transverse strains, such as are produced in
the aerial parts of upright plants by the action of the wind.</p>

the comparatively regular forms of these absorbents, there are forms composed of
amorphous masses of fenestrated cells. It should be added that both the regular

abundant, and in others scarcely to be found. Possibly their presence depends
on the age of the turnip.</p>

phloem, occupies the centre, and is more or less surrounded by the
other, as seen in <a href="#fig_310">Fig. 310</a>. Meristem tissue is never present, hence
concentric bundles are always closed. They, however, occur in the
stems of most ferns, and are always surrounded by a pericycle and
endodermis, and should be regarded as steles. Concentric bundles
with a central phloem occur in the
rhizomes of some monocotyles, as
Calamus, Iris, Convallaria, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>The Stele, or Vascular Cylinder</i>, is
developed from the phloem of the
growing plant, and consists of one
or more vasal bundles imbedded in
fundamental tissue, the whole being
enclosed by a pericycle and an endoderm.
The typical <i>stele</i> includes all
the tissues evolved by the endodermis,
which, however, forms no
part of the vascular cylinder itself,
but merely surrounds it. The pericycle
is always the outermost layer
of the tissues of the stele, while the
endodermis is the innermost layer of
the extra-stelar tissues.</p>

<p>The arboreus type of stem can be
best followed by making sections of
a twig of the elm (<i>Ulmus campestris</i>), which will be found to be
cylindrical hirsute, green or brown according to age, the latter colour
being due to the formation of <i>cork</i>. Small brown excrescences are
scattered over its surface; these are termed <i>lenticels</i>. The cork will
be seen to lie immediately below the epidermis, and to consist of
cubical cells, with little or no cell contents; they are arranged in
radial rows, without intercellular spaces. The walls of these cork
cells will stain yellowish-brown with Schultze’s solution. Treat
a thin section with sulphuric acid and the walls will swell out and
gradually lose their sharpness of outline, with the exception of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
cuticularised outer wall of the epidermis and the <i>cork</i>. This material
is occasionally found developed in the twigs of the elm, so that it
can be separated as thick radial plates of tissue.</p>

<p>“By comparing sections of twigs cut of various ages, the following
information may be gleaned: That cork cambium, or <i>phellogen</i>,
appears as a layer of cortical cells below the epidermis, and that these
divide parallel to the surface of the stem. The result of successive
divisions in this direction is the formation of secondary tissue,
which develops externally as cork, internally as phelloderm. The
true cork cambium consists of only a single cell in each radial row,
from which, by successive division, all these secondary tissues are
derived&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, cambium of vascular bundles. As stems grow older,
layers of cork appear successively further and further from the
external surface; not only the cortex, but also the outer portions
of the phloem are thus cut off from physiological connection with
the inner tissue. The term <i>bark</i> is applied to tissues thus cut off,
together with the cork which forms the physiological boundary.
The stem of Vitis affords a good example of such successive layers
of cork.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
plants. Below the epidermis a thick walled band of sclerenchyma
with lignified walls will be seen distinct from the vascular bundles,
which readily take a stain. The vascular bundles are separate and
distinct, and the structure of the bundle is abnormal, there being in
each a separate central mass of xylem, with the phloem masses lying,
the one central, the other in the peripheral side. Between the
xylem and the phloem masses is the cambium layer. The structure
being the same in both will serve for the study of the punctate
sieve-plates; these are readily stained with eosin, as shown in Sach’s
text-book.</p>

<p><i>Laticiferous Tissues</i> (<a href="#fig_318">Fig. 318</a>).&mdash;In cutting sections of latex
care must be taken to at once transfer them to alcohol so as to
prevent the flow of the latex from the cells, otherwise the laticiferous
vessels will be much less easily traced. The better method is to
plunge the root of the dandelion (<i>Leontodon taraxacum</i>), after
cleaning, into alcohol, and there let it remain until it has become
hardened; then cut thin tangential sections from the phloem, and
longitudinal sections through the cambium, and mount them in
potash and glycerine. The laticiferous vessels appear circular in
the transverse sections with brown contents; these are distributed
in groups round the central xylem. Observe in such sections the
presence of sphere crystals of inulin. These are formed quite
irrespective of the cell-walls.</p>

<p>Laticiferous cells are readily seen in the cortex of <i>Euphorbia
splendens</i>, cut just outside the vascular ring. Long tubes will be
seen to run through the cortical parenchyma, with thick cellulose
walls and granular contents. These are the laticiferous cells, the
branching of which distinguishes them from the preceding structure.
Included in the granular contents are starch grains of a peculiar
dumb-bell form.</p>

<p><i>Leaf or Petiole.</i>&mdash;The general morphology of leaf tissue is
essentially the same as that of the stem from which it proceeds. In
the typical monostotic stem of Phanerogam&aelig; each leaf receives a
portion of the stele or central cylinder of the stem. Such portion
is termed a meristele, and may be either entire or split up into a
number of schizosteles.</p>

<p>The microscopical structure of leaves should be studied in the
whole organ, and by the aid of isolating elements. The whole or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
portion of a leaf should be soaked in chloral hydrate solution; this
will render it transparent, whereby the internal structure can be
studied as a whole. Sections should be prepared from fresh leaves,
or dried ones softened by soaking in water. Cut them transversely,
both in the direction of the mid-rib and at right angles to it. This
is best effected by placing the material between two pieces of elder
pith or fresh carrot. Sections of the whole are made and transferred
to a dish of water. Leaf sections are easily made for examination
by macerating the leaves in solution of caustic potash varying in
strength from one to five per cent. The epidermis on both sides may
be detached, and the elements of the mesophyll and vascular bundles
isolated for separate examination.</p>

<p>Potassium permanganate proves to be a useful reagent. A weak
solution causes the protoplasmic structures to swell up, thus assisting
in the observation of the structure of the chromatophores. This
solution may also be employed as a macerating fluid. Beautiful
preparations are obtained in this way of the sieve-tubes of Vitis.</p>

<p>Special structural peculiarities are to be observed in the leaves of
various plants in which the epidermis consists of more than a single
layer of cells (<i>e.g.</i>, the leaves of Ficus, Peperace&aelig;, Begoniace&aelig;, &amp;c.),
cystoleths in the cells of the epidermis of Urtica; glandular structure
in Ruta, Psorales; the coriaceous leaves of the Cherry Laurel, and
the cylindrical leaves of Stonecrop (<i>Sedum acre</i>).</p>

<p><i>Reproductive Organs.</i>&mdash;The development of the rudiments of
flowers is of an extremely interesting nature, and the complete
flower should be carefully studied. Median sections are best suited
for the purpose. In the large majority of plants the calyx is
developed first, then the corolla, and next the stamens. Preparations
should be made from materials hardened in alcohol, or first
fixed with a strong solution of picric acid and then hardened in
alcohol.</p>

<p><i>Pollen-grains.</i>&mdash;Microspores are found lying free in sections made
of the reproductive organs; these may be transferred to a glycerine
fluid and examined under a high power. They are mostly spherical,
with granular protoplasmic contents, in which with much difficulty
two nuclei can be made out. Mount and examine, as types of the
various forms of granules, the pollen of Helianthus, Althœa, Cucurbita,
&AElig;nothera, Orchis, Mimosa, Tulipa, &amp;c. Mount any of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
pollen-grains in a weak solution of cane-sugar (about five per cent.),
examine with a high power, and note the configuration of their
walls with a medium power under polarised light. If transverse
sections be made from very young buds, the development of the
anther and the pollen may be traced. The material should be
preserved in strong alcohol, and the sections treated with equal parts
of alcohol and glycerine, and exposed in a watch-glass that the
alcohol may evaporate. By this method sections may be prepared
for illustrating the formation
of the <i>tapetum</i>, special
mother-cells, and division of
the nucleus.</p>

<p><i>Starch Granules.</i>&mdash;One of
the most universally distributed
materials found in
plants is starch composed of
two substances, <i>granulose</i>,
which constitutes by far the
largest part, and a skeleton
of <i>farinose</i>. It is only the
former of these that stains
blue with iodine solutions;
the latter partially assumes
a brownish colour. The
structure of starch granules is not of equal density throughout;
the hilum or nuclear portion is most conspicuous, around which
the rest of the material is deposited in layers, indicative of stratification.
The several layers next to the hilum are less dense than
those farthest from it. The position of the hilum determines the
form of the grain, a few being rounded, others oval or elongated.
The grain also contains different proportions of water; this conveys
the appearance of concentric lines or curves about the nucleus. The
latter is more conspicuous in the potato starches, as seen in <a href="#pl_xiii">Plate XIII</a>.,
Nos. 6-15. Starch grains, in nearly all cases, are formed by
the agency of proteid bodies, either chloroplasts or amyloplasts,
and under the action of sunlight are gradually broken up and
employed in the process of growth. There are some plants, however,
notably the Composite&aelig;, in which another carbohydrate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
<i>inulin</i>, takes the place of starch from the first, and is used as a
reserve food material. For this reason we look in vain for starch
in the cells of Inula, Taraxacum, &amp;c. From the whole group
of fungi starch is absent; this seems to explain the fact that chlorophyll,
or colouring matter, is rarely met with in the fungi,
hence their inability to utilize, like green plants, carbon-dioxide
as food.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Fig. 320.&mdash;Swollen Potato Starch, after the application of potassium hydrate.
(Magnified 210 diameters.)</p></div>

<p>The tissues which most commonly contain starch, or which contain
it in largest quantity, are those of the parenchymatous series, though
it sometimes occurs in the latex of laticiferous tissues, and even in
ducts and tracheids. In the stems of Dicotyledons it occurs chiefly
in the parenchyma of the middle and inner bark, in the medullary
ray cells, and in the cells of the pith. In the roots of these plants
it has a similar distribution, being for the most part confined to
the middle or inner bark and the medullary rays, pith not being
present in these organs. In succulent stems and roots, of course,
it also commonly occurs in the xylem tissues of the fibro-vascular
bundles.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span></p>

<p>A study of the various kinds of starches is important, since this
material is very largely used as an adulterant. Other than microscopical
means of detecting frauds are practically useless; assaying is
tedious and expensive, while the microscope is always available and
at hand. The limits of variation should be studied in starches from
the same species of plants; the variations are not very wide, but
in most cases characteristic, so that the discrimination is at all
times an easy task. The reagents required are simply iodine and
dilute potassium hydrate, aided by polarised light.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>The starch grains of the potato are the best to study in the first
instance on account of their large size (<a href="#fig_320">Fig. 320</a>).</p>

<p>In arrowroot starch (<a href="#fig_321">Fig. 321</a>) the stratification is almost as
distinct as in that of the potato; the grains much resemble each
other. Although somewhat smaller, the grains of arrowroot are
more uniform in size. The starches are much used as an adulterant
of drugs and various articles sold as cocoas.</p>

<p>Wheat-starch (<a href="#fig_322">Fig. 322</a>) consists of circular flattened grains
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
varying much in size, the central nucleus and stratification of
which are very difficult to distinguish.</p>

<p>In the smaller starches the hilum becomes more indistinct, and
without stratification, as in rice-starch, the latter being angular in
shape. The hilum in other leguminous plants forms a longitudinal
cleft; white rye-starch exhibits distinct cracks. Compound grains are
occasionally met with, as in the oat. In <a href="#pl_xiii">Plate XIII</a>. will be found
small groups of starches taken under the same medium power for
the sake of comparison. In the microscopical examination of starches
first use a <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>-inch or a &frac12;-inch and then a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub>-inch objective.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Husks of Wheat-starch, swollen by reagents and heat; <i>b.</i> A portion of
cellulose; <i>c.</i> Rice-starch, magnified 420 diameters.</p></div>

<p>The bran of the husk of wheat when broken by grinding is seen
to be composed of two coats of hexagonal cells, the outer of which
is detached by the roasting process. The hexagonal cell layer is,
however, so little altered as to be perfectly distinguishable under
the microscope. Thus even a small admixture of roasted corn
with coffee or chicory can be detected without much difficulty. As
to whether starch granules should be regarded as crystalline or colloid
bodies, a difference of opinion still prevails. There are, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
reasons for believing that the polarisation effects produced by starch
grains are not due to crystalline structure but to stress or strain, of
the same nature as the polarisation of glass when it is subject to
strain. The polarising phenomena are precisely such as would be
induced in any transparent solid composed of layers, the inner of
which being kept in a state of stress by the compression exerted
by the outer layers. Moreover, when by use of a swelling reagent,
such as caustic potash solution, the outer wall of the starch is made
to expand by the imbibition of water, the polarisation effects immediately
disappear. Were the solid particles of crystal thus forced
apart by water each particle would still exhibit polarisation phenomena.</p>

<p>Want of space will not permit me to further enlarge upon
other micro-chemical substances that enter into the composition of
plants; as, for example, the oil secreting glands. These when present
take the place of starch. There is, however, one product among the
cell contents of plants of some interest to the microscopist&mdash;those
extremely fine crystals known as <i>raphides</i>, composed of calcium-phosphate
and oxalate. Mr. Gulliver insisted upon the value of
raphides as characteristic of several families of plants. Schleiden
states that “needle-formed crystals, in bundles of from twenty to
thirty in a cell, are present in almost all plants,” and that so really
practical is the presence or absence of raphides, that by studying
them he has been able to pick out pots of seedling Onagrace&aelig;,
which had been accidentally mixed with pots of other seedlings of
the same age, and at that period of growth when no other botanical
character would have been so readily sufficient.</p>

<p>If we examine a portion of the layers of an onion (<a href="#pl_xiv">Plate XIV</a>.,
No. 3), or a thin section of the stem or root of the garden rhubarb
(No. 4), we shall find many cells in which either bundles of needle-shaped
crystals or masses of a stellate form occur, not strictly
raphides.</p>

<p>Raphides were first noticed by Malpighi in Opuntia, and subsequently
described by Jurine and Raspail. According to the latter
observer, the needle-shaped or acicular are composed of phosphate, and
the stellate of oxalate of lime. There are others having lime as a
basis, in combination with tartaric, malic, and citric acids, all of
which are destroyed by acetic acid; others are soluble in many of
the fluids employed in mounting. These crystals vary in size from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>40</sub>th of an inch, while others are as small as the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>1000</sub>th. They
occur in all parts of the plant; in the stem, bark, leaf, petals,
fruit, root, and even in the pollen, and occasionally in the interior
of cells. In certain species of aloe, as <i>Aloe verrucosa</i>, we are able to
discern small silky filaments; these are bundles of the acicular form
of raphides, and probably, as in sponges, act as a skeleton support
to the internal soft pulpy mass.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption">PLATE XIV.</p>
<img id="pl_xiv" src="images/pl_xiv.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">STELLATE AND CRYSTALLINE TISSUE OF PLANTS.</p></div>

<p>In portions of the cuticle of the medicinal squill (<i>Scilla maritima</i>)
large cells are found full of needle-shaped crystals. These cells,
however, do not lie in the same plane as the smaller cells of the
cuticle. In the cuticle of an onion every cell is occupied either by
an octahedral or a prismatic crystal of calcium oxalate. In some
specimens the octahedral form predominates; in others, even from the
same plant, the crystals are prismatic and arranged in a stellate form,
as in that of the grass (<i>Pharus cristatus</i>). (<a href="#pl_xiv">Plate XIV</a>., No. 6.)</p>

<p>Raphides of peculiar figure are found in the bark of certain trees.
In the hickory (<i>Carya alba</i>) may be observed masses of flattened
prisms having both extremities pointed. In vertical sections from
the stem of <i>El&aelig;agnus angustifolia</i>, numerous raphides of large size
are embedded in the pith, and also found in the bark of the apple-tree,
and in elm seeds, every cell containing two or more minute
crystals.</p>

<p>In the Graminace&aelig;, especially the canes; in the <i>Equisetum
hyemale</i>, or Dutch rush; in the husk of rice, wheat, and other grains,
silica in some form or other is abundant. Some have beautifully-arranged
masses of silica with raphides. The leaves of <i>Deutzia
scabia</i>, No. 7, are remarkable for their stellate hairs, developed from
the cuticle of both their upper and under surfaces; forming most
interesting and attractive objects examined under polarised light.
(<a href="#pl_viii">Plate VIII</a>., No. 173.)</p>

<p>Silica is found in the structure of Rubiace&aelig; both in the stem and
leaves, and, if present in sufficient thickness, depolarises light. This
is especially the case in the glandular hairs on the margins of the
leaves. One of the order Composit&aelig;, a plant popularly known as the
“sneezewort” (<i>Archill&aelig; ptarmica</i>), has a large amount of silica in the
hairs found about the serratures of its leaves.</p>

<p>All plants are provided with hairs; some few with hairs of a
defensive character. Those in the <i>Urtica dioica</i>, commonly called
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
the <i>Stinging-nettle</i>, are glandular hairs, developed from the cuticle,
and contain an irritating fluid; in other hairs a circulation is visible:
examined under a power of 100 diameters, they present the appearance
seen at <a href="#pl_xiii">Plate XIII</a>., No. 19.</p>

<p>The fibrous tissue of plants is of great value in many manufactures.
It supplies material for our linens, cordage, paper, and other industries.
This tissue is remarkable for toughness of fibre, and exhibits
an approach to indestructibility, in the use it is put to in connection
with the electric light. It is of importance, then, to be able to
distinguish it from other fibres with which it is often mixed in
various manufactures. Here the use of the microscope is found of
considerable importance. In flax and hemp, in which the fibres
are of great length, there are traces of transverse markings at short
intervals. In the rough condition in which flax is imported into this
country, the fibres have been separated, to a certain extent, by a
process termed <i>hackling</i>, and further subjected to hackling, maceration,
and bleaching, before it can be reduced to the white silky
condition required by the spinner and weaver, and finally assumes
the appearance of structureless tubes, <a href="#fig_323">Fig. 323</a> <small>B</small>. China-grass,
New Zealand flax, and some other plants produce a similar material,
but are not so strong, in consequence of the outer membrane containing
more <i>lignine</i>. It is important to the manufacturer that he
should be able to determine the true character of some of the textures
employed in articles of clothing; this he may do by the aid of
the microscope. In linen we find each component thread made up
of the longitudinal, unmarked fibres of flax; but if cotton has been
mixed, we recognise a flattened, more or less rounded band, as
in <a href="#fig_323">Fig. 323</a> <small>A</small>, having a very striking resemblance to hair, which, in
reality, it is; since, in the condition of elongated cells, it lines the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
inner surface of the pod. These, again, should he contrasted with
the filaments of silk, <a href="#fig_323">Fig. 323</a> <small>C</small>, and also of wool, <a href="#fig_323">Fig. 323</a> <small>D</small>.
The latter may be at once recognised by the zigzag transverse markings
on its fibres. The surface of wool is covered with furrowed and
twisted fine cross lines, of which there are from 2,000 to 4,000 in
an inch. On this structure depends its <i>felting</i> property, in judging
of fleeces, attention should be paid
to the fineness and elasticity of the
fibre&mdash;the furrowed and scaly surface,
as shown by the microscope, the quantity
of fibre in a given surface, the
purity of the fleece, upon which depend
the success of the scouring and subsequent
operations.</p>

<p>In the mummy-cloths of the Egyptians
flax only was used, whereas the
Peruvians used cotton alone. By the
many improvements introduced into
manufacturing processes, flax has been
reduced to the fineness and texture of
silk, and even made to resemble other
materials.</p>

<p><i>Fossil Plants.</i>&mdash;It is well known that
the primordial forests furnish a number
of families of plants familiar to the
modern alg&aelig;ologist. The cord-like plant,
<i>Chorda filium</i>, known as “dead men’s
ropes,” from its proving fatal at times
to the too adventurous swimmer who
gets entangled in its thick wreaths, had
a Lower Silurian representative, known to pal&aelig;ontologists as <i>Pal&aelig;ochorda</i>,
or ancient chorda, which existed, apparently, in two species,&mdash;a
larger and a smaller. The still better known <i>Chondrus crispus</i>,
the Irish moss, or Carrageen moss, has likewise its apparent, though
more distant representative, in chondritis, a Lower Silurian algal, of
which there seems to exist at least three species. The fucoids, or
kelpweeds, appear to have also their representatives in such plants as
<i>Fucoides gracilis</i>, of the Lower Silurians of the Malverns; in short, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
Thallogens of the first ages of vegetable life seem to have resembled
in the group, and in at least their more prominent features, the alg&aelig;
of the existing time. And with the first indications of land we pass
from the thallogens to the acrogens&mdash;from the seaweeds to the fern-allies.
The Lycopodiace&aelig;, or club-mosses, bear in the axils of their
leaves minute circular cases, which form the receptacles of their spore-like
seeds. And when high in the Upper Silurian system, and
just when preparing to quit it for the Lower Old Red Sandstone, we
detect our earliest terrestrial organisms, we find that they are composed
exclusively of those little spore-receptacles.</p>

<p>The existing plants whence we derive our analogies in dealing
with the vegetation of this early period contribute but little, if at
all, to the support of animal life. The ferns and their allies remain
untouched by the grazing animals. Our native club-mosses, though
once used in medicine, are positively deleterious; horsetails (<i>Equisetace&aelig;</i>),
though harmless, so abound in silex, which wrap them round
with a cuticle of stone, that they are rarely cropped by cattle; while
the thickets of fern which cover our hill and dell, and seem so temptingly
rich and green in their season, scarce support the existence of
a single creature, and remain untouched, in stem and leaf, from their
first appearance in spring until they droop and wither under the
frosts of early winter.</p>

<p>The flora of the coal measures was the richest and most luxuriant,
in at least individual productions, with which the fossil botanist has
formed an acquaintance. Never before or since did our planet bear
so rank a vegetation as that of which the numerous coal seams and
inflammable shales of the carboniferous period form but a portion of
the remains&mdash;the portion spared, in the first instance, by dissipation
and decay, and in the second by denuding agencies. Nevertheless
almost all our coal&mdash;the stored-up fuel of a world&mdash;is not, as
it is often said to be, the product of destroyed forests of conifers and
flora of the profuse vegetation of the earliest periods in the history
of our globe. Later investigations show that our coal measures are
the compressed accumulations of peat-bogs which, layer by layer,
have sunken down under the superimposed weight of the next. The
vertical stems of coniferous trees became imbedded by a natural
process of decay, and were subsequently overwhelmed in the erect
position in which they are found. The true grasses scarcely appear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
in the fossil state at all. For the first time, amid the remains of a
flora that seems to have had but few flowers&mdash;the Oolitic ages&mdash;do
we detect, in a few broken fragments of the wings of butterflies,
decided traces of the flower-sucking insects. Not, however, until we
enter into the great Tertiary division do these become numerous.
The first bee makes its appearance in the amber of the Eocene,
locked up hermetically in its gem-like tomb&mdash;an embalmed corpse in
a crystal coffin&mdash;along with fragments of flower-bearing herbs and
trees. Her tomb remains to testify to the gradual fitting up of our
earth as a place of habitation for creatures destined to seek delight
for the mind and eye, as certainly as for the proper senses, and in
especial marks the introduction of the stately forest trees, and the
arrival of the charmingly beautiful flowers that now deck the earth.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>

<h2 id="PART_II_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>The Sub-kingdom Protozoa.</h3>

<p>The consideration of the whole special group of organisms forming
the subject matter of this chapter, under the heading of Protozoa,
were formerly included among Infusoria, which also embraced
every kind of microscopical aquatic body, whether belonging to the
vegetable or animal series. A more critical survey of the organisation
and affinities of Infusoria and the members which constituted
the group led to a re-arrangement, which has been very generally
accepted as forming a sub-kingdom, Protozoa. This may be defined as
embracing all those forms of life, referable to the lowest grade of the
animal kingdom, whose members for the most part are represented
by organisms possessing a single cell or aggregation of cells (and
also included under the general term of unicellular organisms) the
whole of which are engaged in feeding, moving, respiring, and
reproducing by segmentation or fission much in the same way as that
of the unicellular plants described in a previous chapter. Following
out this sub-division of the entire series of Protozoa, the several
groups range themselves into four readily distinguishable sections.
In the first, the most lowly organised and most abundant have no
oral orifice in the literal meaning of the word, food being intercepted
at any point of the surface of the body. This most simple elementary
type of structure of the Protozoa is represented in the Amœba and
Actinophrys, the various representatives of the Foraminifera, and
certain Flagellata, as Spumella and Anthrophysa. Next in the
ascending scale is a group of Protozoa, in which, though differentiation
has not proceeded so far as to arrive at the constitution
of a distinct oral aperture, the inception of food substance is limited
to a discoidal area occupying the anterior extremity of the body and
is associated with the special food-arresting apparatus. To this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
section of the Protozoa are relegated the minuter flagellate, “collar-bearing”
animals, and also the entire group of sponges or Porifera.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Gregarinida, Polycystina, Foraminifera, Rotifera, etc.</span></p>
<img id="pl_iii" src="images/pl_iii.jpg" alt="" />

<span class="tcell x-small tdr">Edmund Evans.</span>
</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate III.</span></p></div>

<p>In the third section the highest degree of organisation is arrived
at. Here is represented a single, simple, often highly-differentiated
oral aperture or true mouth. Associated with this section are found
the majority of those organisms that collectively constitute the class
Infusoria in the proper acceptation of the term, and it embraces the
majority of the Ciliata, the Cilio-flagellata, as Euglena, Chilomonas,
&amp;c., in which the presence of a distinct and circumscribed oral
aperture is clearly seen. With the fourth and remaining section of
Protozoa, the oral or inceptive apparatus exhibits a highly characteristic
structural modification. This is not restricted to a definite area,
nor is it associated with the entire surface of the body, but it consists
of a number of flexible, retractile, tentacle-like organs radiating from
diverse and definite regions of the periphery, each of which subserves
as a tubular sucking-mouth, or for the purpose of grasping food. These
may be literally described as many-mouthed, and have been appropriately
designated Polystomata. The true zoological position of the
Spongida or Porifera is not finally settled, the members of this
important section having been formerly regarded as a subordinate
group of the Rhizopoda or an independent class of the Protozoa;
consequently a tendency has been shown to assign to them a position
more nearly approximating to that of the Cœlenterata, or zoophytes
and corals, or place them among the more highly organised tissue-constructed
animals, the Metazoa, these being characterised by
groups of cells set apart to perform certain functions for the whole
animal. A division of labour is seen to be marked in these lower
animals as the organism becomes more specialised, and the number
of functions a cell performs becomes more and more limited as the
body becomes more complex.</p>

<p>It has been found convenient to adopt the following definition of
the Infusoria as one more generally acceptable. The Protozoa in
their adult condition are furnished with prehensile or locomotive
organs, that take the form of cilia, flagella, or of adhesive or
suctorial tentacula, but not of simple pseudopodia; their zooids are
essentially unicellular, free swimming or sedentary; they are either
naked, loricate, or inhabit a simple, mucilaginous matrix; single or
united in aggregations, in which the individual units are distinctly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
recognisable; not united and forming a single gelatinous plasmodium,
as in Mycetozoa, nor immersed within and lining the interior cavities
of a complex protoplasmic and mostly spiculiferous skeleton, as in
the Spongida, their food substances being intercepted by a single
distinct oral aperture, or by several apertures through a limited
terminal region or through the entire area of the general surface of
the body. They increase by simple longitudinal or transverse fission,
by external or internal gemmation or division, preceded mostly by a
quiescent or encysted state, into a greater or less number of sporular
bodies. Sexual elements, as represented by true ova or spermatozoa,
are entirely absent, but two or more zooids frequently coalesce as an
antecedent process to the phenomena of open formation.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>The infusorial body in its simplest type of development, as in
Amœba, exhibits a structural composition substantially corresponding
with that of the lowest organised tissue cell. There is no distinct
bounding membrane, or cell-wall, and it is throughout, and apart from
the nucleus or endopart, one continuous mass of granular matter,
but otherwise homogeneous and undifferentiated protoplasm. Professor
Greef, who has made a study of the Amœba, describes motor
fibrils in the exoplasm which are active and large in <i>A. terricola</i>.
These are readily seen by staining with osmic acid, and, after washing
this out with water, immersing in a weak alcoholic solution. In
Amœba so prepared and examined with a high power, the whole body
will be seen to be surrounded by a distinct double integumentary layer.
Highly refractive bodies may also be seen in the interior, connected
together by extremely fine filaments. Professor Greef concludes
that here we have to do with muscular fibrill&aelig;, which traverse the
contractile outer zone in a radial direction and there terminate for
the time being. By a similar method, axial filaments can be demonstrated
in Heliozoa; these, it is believed, are the true motors of their
pseudopodia, and also the axial structures of the Acineta, a marine
animal related to ciliate infusoria.</p>

<p>In the Amœba, at one time well known as the <i>Proteus animalcule</i>,
<a href="#fig_325">Fig. 325</a>, the marvellous body creeps onward in a flowing manner,
occasionally and languidly emitting a single pseudopod first on one
side, then on the other. More commonly it puts on a dendroid or
palmate form; then again it assumes more or less grotesque shapes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
in which almost any conceivable image may be imagined. The
body, as will be seen in this highly-magnified figure, is full of
granules (with the exception of a thin clear outer hyaline zone), and
near the centre is a globular or discoid body known as the nucleus,
composed of slightly denser material than that which surrounds it.
The division of the body into two is preceded by a division of this
nucleus. Near the latter is a clear spherical space&mdash;the contractile
vacuole&mdash;which gradually expands, and then rather suddenly collapses
and reappears at the same spot, the systole and diastole being slow
and continuous. The contractile vacuole contains a clear liquid
which is expelled on the collapse of the vacuole. This organ
probably serves the double function of respiration and excretion.
The Amœba is omnivorous, chiefly a vegetarian, and, therefore,
found on the ooze of ponds or on the under surface of the leaves
of aquatic plants, especially among Conferv&aelig;. It can be readily
produced by placing a few fibres of fresh meat in an infusion
of hay.</p>

<p>The Gregarin&aelig; consist of a remarkable group of organisms, but
these, although unicellular, are, for the most part, confined to the
intestinal tract of worms and of the higher animals, and will
therefore be described among internal parasites.</p>

<p>Tho fungus-animals, Mycetozoa, have already been referred to in
a previous chapter. The best known species, however, is found
in tan yards in the form of creeping masses of naked protoplasm,
termed Plasmodia. Cakes of protoplasm become segregated from
the main mass, and break up into Amœba-like spores, which unite
again to form Plasmodia.</p>

<p>The Rhizopoda, or root-footed
class of animals, are
among the most interesting
simple organisms with which
the microscope has made us
acquainted. In the living state
they have the power of protruding
pseudopodia from the
body, by which they creep
about, or cling to plants when
in search of food. This group,
in fact, includes Amœba,
Foraminifera, Sun-animalcules,
and Radiolarians. In the first
the pseudopodia are simple and
lobose; in the second they are slender, confluent and reticulate;
while in the two last they are simple, radiating and somewhat stiff,
and partake of a calcareous formation.</p>

<p>Of the Lobosa, we may take a well-known representative of the
group, the Protomyxa, found at the bottom of fresh-water pools,
especially those near bog-moss, where its minute orange-coloured
particles of jelly-like substance are seen creeping over stones or
shells. If quietly watched the pseudopodia, some of which are
broad and others slender, become quiescent spheres, which break
up into numerous portions, each of which becomes a new animal.</p>

<p>This group is divided into the shell-less (Nuda) and shell-formed
(Testacea). The brown, horny covering is often finely faceted, and
is either shaped like a dome, semi-circular, or flat as a box,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
through which they protrude their few or many pseudopodia (seen
in <a href="#fig_326">Fig. 326</a>).</p>

<img id="pl_xv" src="images/pl_xv.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="caption">GROMIA.</p></div>

<p>In the Difflugia the lorica or shell is strengthened by the addition
of silicious particles; in Euglypta it is sac-shaped, with a jagged
free margin, the surface being covered by overlapping scales; while
Arcella are capable of secreting vesicles of air in their interior,
whereby they are enabled to rise to the surface. On some parts of
our coast, if the sea sand be carefully looked over with a pocket lens,
there will often be found minute grains of a porcelain oval kind,
belonging to the Miliolina, segmented or strung together not quite
in the same plane.</p>

<p>The Foraminifera are rhizopods, whose simple protoplasmic bodies
send forth, through perforations in the membrane or outer covering
of calcium carbonate and silica, branching rays of pseudopodia.
The order is divided into two groups, the Imperforata and the
Perforata; in the former the shell or harder structure possesses only
one or more apertures, whereas in the latter, in addition to the main
opening, the shell has its walls perforated throughout, which admits
of minute pseudopodia or fine threads being protruded (<a href="#fig_328">Fig. 328</a>).
(See also <a href="#pl_iii">Plate III</a>., Nos. 75-85.) The vast majority of Perforata
form their shells, or rather skeletons, of calcium carbonate and silica,
which renders them almost indestructible. Consequently the form
is preserved through ages, and they present objects of the greatest
interest to the microscopist.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span></p>

<p>A curious and interesting feature of the Foraminifera&mdash;often an
element of difficulty to the student&mdash;is the tendency of modifications
of types comprising the larger groups to run into parallel
isomorphous series. Thus, if the entire class be roughly divided,
as it sometimes has been, into three orders, comprising respectively
the forms characterised by porcellaneous, arenaceous, and hyaline
“tests,” the same general conformation and arrangement of chambers
will be found in each of the three series. The most remarkable
example, even among the smaller groups, is the Rotaliid&aelig;, of which
three or four genera may be arranged in parallel lines, and in more
or less closely isomorphous series. In the report appended to the
“Challenger” scheme of classification many examples are enumerated.
In Arenacea we have a small family of Foraminifera, the external
surfaces of which present a ridge and furrow arrangement, and the
incrustations are entirely of a sandy nature held together by a cement
secreted by the animal. (<a href="#pl_xv">Plate XV</a>., No. 1, <i>Astrorhiza limicola</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Gromia.</i>&mdash;Among the more remarkable of the Perforata group the
Gromia have a foremost place. They are very minute globular or
oval-shaped bodies, about one-twenty-fourth of an inch in length,
found in fresh, brackish, and salt water. The forms brought up in
Dr. Wallich’s deep sea soundings of 1860 were taken attached to
pieces of corallines, or found loose among Globigerina ooze. At first
there appears to be nothing peculiar about these tiny specks of matter
resembling the ova of a zoophyte, but presently, at the smaller end,
a very fine thread is protruded, and then another, dividing into finer
branches, and, ultimately, a complete network of filaments extends
on all sides, and become attached to the side of the glass jar that
contains them. Now, on employing magnifying power, every thread
exhibits a circulatory motion, an up and down stream or cyclosis of
granules suspended in a fluid mass. It is by means of these pseudopodia,
as the threads are termed, that the Gromia moves its body along
and clings to the glass. We may surmise, then, that these pseudopodia
are either gelatinous, glutinous, or terminate in sucker-like processes.
Increase in the “test,” integument, is brought about, as in Difflugia,
by the secretion of calcareous matter or by cementing fine silicious
particles to the outer wall, as the protoplasm is seen to flow over the
test, so that when it comes in contact with a diatom it is thereby
drawn towards the oral opening and slowly digested.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span></p>

<p>Some considerable time elapsed between the discovery of Gromia
by Mr. W. Archer, F.R.S., and the demonstration of a nucleus and
contractile vesicle by Dr. Wallich. It was thought that in the
whole of the Monozoa the nucleus was absent, but it is now known
that this important body is embedded in the protoplasmic substance,
and the reproduction of these curious animals is thereby secured.
Among the better known species of Gromia is <i>G. Dujardinii</i>, chiefly
distinguishable by the darker colour of the “test,” by the greater
quantity of silica that enters into the formation of its pseudopodia,
and by the formation of isogamous zoospores, two of which are seen
in conjugation in <a href="#pl_xv">Plate XV</a>., No. 2. An excess of protoplasm must
also be secreted to admit of so large a protrusion outside the testa.</p>

<p><i>G. Lieberk&uuml;hnia</i> (of Clapar&egrave;de and Lachman), No. 5, differs in
formation. Its shape is pyriform, and the opening whence the
pseudopodia streams out is situated in a lateral depression about
midway in the testa, <i>c, o</i>. Hence a trunk branch is seen to issue
forth, and from this a ramification of threads, <i>psdp</i>, extends to a
considerable distance in all directions.</p>

<p>The Micro-gromia of Hertwig, No. 4, is the minutest form of the
genus yet discovered, and differs from those already described in the
mode of reproduction. The individual takes the shape of a water
bottle with a short neck, whence issue forth a limited number of
very slender threads. The test is quite transparent, and it was
in this species that the nucleus and contractile vesicle, which lie
embedded near the mouth, were first clearly made out.</p>

<p>The zoospores of Micro-gromia have a curious habit of uniting
with their neighbours to form a colony, No. 4. Their colonisation
is apparently intended to facilitate multiplication. Reproduction is
carried on somewhat after the manner of Volvox. The globular bodies
formed sink to the bottom of the glass vessel, and there remain
for a time in a quiescent state. In the course of a day or two the
mass assumes a motive appearance, increases in bulk, becomes more
ovoid in shape, and ultimately the nucleus shows the first sign of
division. Vertical segmentation takes place, as at A, into two equal
parts; each half is seen to possess its fair share of the nucleus and
contractile vesicle. It then turns in the horizontal direction, and now
there appears to be an upper and a lower division, the uppermost
having a neck-like attachment, and this is making its way to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
narrow oral opening in the parent testa, as at <small>B</small>. Here it is seen
pressing forward, and at <small>C</small> the neck is protruding some distance, and
the second half assumes a bottle shape; at <small>D</small> the greater part of the
animal is nearly set free, and after a short rest it fully launches forth.
It finally pulls itself together, as at <small>E</small>, and either develops a pair of
flagella and swims off, or assumes the form of an Actinophrys. In
either case, and in a very short space of time, the separated young
animal is quite ready to re-unite, as at <small>F</small>, and assist in forming a
new colony of the species.</p>

<p>The Polymorphina belong to a low genus of the Foraminifera.
They consist of a number of forms and exhibit a rather extensive
series of variations, although consisting of a few simple types, and
showing transitions between forms which at first seem to be distinct.
The majority of species keep to the sea bottom; some few are
pelagic, and occur in abundance on the surface of the ocean.
Among the latter are the Globigerina: its shell is about one-fortieth
of an inch in diameter, and usually composed of seven globular
chambers arranged spirally in such a manner that all are visible
from above, each chamber opening by a crescentic-shaped orifice
into a depression in the middle of the next. Perfect specimens
bristle with long slender spines, the pores affording passage to pseudopodia,
which stream out along the spines. The more carefully-conducted
deep-sea investigations have brought to light the fact that
the floor of the ocean, at great depths, and over a vast area, is
formed of these white or pinkish coloured bodies, all containing
on an average about 60 per cent. of calcium carbonate. It is a
question whether the Globigerinid&aelig; which make up the bulk of
the ooze actually live at the bottom as well as the surface of
the sea. This question has given rise to much discussion. Dr.
Murray came to the conclusion that pelagic species do not live
near the ocean floor. This opinion is partly based on the fact
that the area of the Globigerina ooze coincides with the area of
surface of temperature at which these bodies are found to exist.
When the surface water is too cold for them, they are not to be
found, neither are they found below. Major S. R. J. Owen,
while dredging the surface of mid-ocean&mdash;the Indian, and the warmer
portion of the Atlantic&mdash;found attached to his nets a number of
these interesting bodies, and which always made their appearance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
just about sunset. In <a href="#pl_iii">Plate III</a>., Nos. 43-52, a number of these
interesting and variously-formed bodies are given, and an attempt is
also made to show the richly-tinted colour appearances presented
by the sarcode or protoplasm of the Globigerina.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_329" src="images/fig_329.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 329.&mdash;Globigerina and other bodies taken in deep sea soundings (Atlantic).</p></div>

<p>“Many of the forms,” writes Major Owen,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> “have hitherto been
claimed by the geologist, but I have found them enjoying life in this
their true home, the silicious shells filled with coloured sarcode, and
sometimes this sarcode in a state of distension somewhat similar to
that found projecting from the Foraminifera, but not in such slender
threads. There are no objects in nature more brilliant in their
colouring or more exquisitely delicate in their forms and structure.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
Some are of but one colour, crimson, yellow, or blue; sometimes
two colours are found on the same individual, but always separate,
and rarely if ever mixed to form green or purple. In a globular
species, whose shell is made up of the most delicate fretwork, the
brilliant colours of the sarcode shine through the little perforations
very prettily. In specimens of the triangular and square forms
(<a href="#pl_iii">Plate III</a>., Nos. 43, 44, 45 and 46), the respective tints of yellow
and crimson are vivid and delicately shaded; in one the pink lines
are concentric; while another is of a stellate form, the points and
uncoloured parts being bright clear crystal, while a beautiful crimson
ring surrounds the central portion. A globular form resembles a
specimen of the Chinese ball-cutting&mdash;one sphere within another;
this, however, appears to belong to a distinct species.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_330" src="images/fig_330.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 330.&mdash;Globigerina and other bodies taken in deep sea soundings, 1856
(Atlantic).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span></p></div>

<p>“The shells of some of the globular forms of these Polycystina,
whose conjugation I believe I have witnessed, are composed of a
fine fretwork, with one or more large circular holes; and I suspect
the junction to take place by the union of two such apertures.
That the figures of these shells become elongated, lose their
globular form after death, and present a disturbed surface is seen
in some of the figures represented in <a href="#pl_iii">Plate III</a>., Nos. 82-85.”
Those without internal chambers have been described as <i>Orbulina
universa</i>, <a href="#pl_iii">Plate III</a>., <a href="#fig_78">Fig. 78</a>, while Nos. 75 and 76, although
members of the same family, have been separated, but all should
certainly be united under Globigerina.</p>

<p>“The minute silicious shells of Polycystina present wonderful
beauty and variety of form; all are more or less perforated, and
often prolonged into spines or other projections, through which
the sarcode body extends itself into pseudopodial prolongations
resembling those of Actinophrys. When seen disporting themselves
in all their living splendour, their brilliancy of colouring renders
them objects of unusual attraction. It will appear that they wish
to avoid the light, as they are rarely found on the surface of the
sea in the daytime; it is after sunset and during the twilight
that they make their appearance.”</p>

<p>Many forms of Globigerina and Foraminifera are represented in
Figs. 329 and 330. These varied and beautiful forms were dredged
up with soundings made in 1856 for the purpose of ascertaining
the depth of the Atlantic, prior to the laying down of the electric
telegraph wire from England to America, and taken at a depth
of 2,070 fathoms.</p>

<p><i>Heliozoa.</i>&mdash;<i>Actinophrys-Sol</i>, “sun-animalcules,” belong to this
group; most of them inhabit fresh water (<a href="#pl_iii">Plate III</a>., No. 66). The
chief characteristic, and the one to which they owe their name, is the
possession of long, slender, somewhat stiff pseudopodia; these radiate
from all parts of the body. The living animal usually contains
green-coloured particles within a minute translucent spherical globule
of about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>250</sub>th of an inch in diameter. It is, therefore, variously
designated the green sun-animalcule, Acanthocystis, or Actinophrys-Sol.
It is commonly found amongst the weeds in clear pools of
water, where desmids abound. The pseudopodia appear to be stiff;
they are, however, quite flexible, and the body contains more than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
one clear vesicle with a nucleus; reproduction is secured by the
simple division commencing in the nucleus. The little animal
can move over a hard surface by the alternate relaxation and
stiffening of its pseudopodia; when one of these touches a
small organism, it is believed to paralyse it, then envelop, and
deliberately digest it. In another species, the lattice-animalcule
(Cathrulina), the pseudopodia or silicious threads are arranged tangentially.
It grows on a long flexible stalk, attached to an aquatic
plant, the total length of which is about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>200</sub>th an inch. The
globular body is perforated in all directions, through which the fine
stiff pseudopodia are thrust out; it is often known to form colonies.</p>

<p>In this order may well be placed the Radiolaria; they are,
however, usually separated. But Radiolarians, whether seen alive
or in their skeleton form, are surpassingly beautiful. By the favour
of Messrs. Warne, I am enabled to append a frontispiece plate to this
volume taken from their “Royal Natural History.” These bodies
are all marine, and live in zones of several thousand fathoms, and like
their congeners, the Globigerina, they avoid a strong light, and
only appear after sunset. Their bodies are supposed to emit a
phosphorescent glow, but more is known of their silicious skeletons
than of their living forms; yet it is not this feature that separates
them from other orders of rhizopods, but the possession of a
membranous central capsule enclosing the nucleus. The body
substance outside this capsule is highly vacuolated in some species,
especially in surface forms. A few are without a skeleton, and these
consist of oval masses of protoplasm, with slender pseudopodia. In
a few species the skeleton is formed of a glassy horny substance,
termed acanthin, arranged in the form of radiating spines.</p>

<p>Radiolarians secrete a silicious skeleton, which assumes a variety
of forms, as trellis-work, boxes joined by radiating spines, helmets,
baskets, bee-hives, discs, rings, and numerous other forms. Haeckel
has described upwards of four thousand species, and possibly as
many more could be added to this number. Radiolaria are divided
into two groups. In the one there is either no skeleton or one of silex;
in the other the skeleton is formed of radiating spines of a horny
nature. These are again subdivided according to the characters of
the central capsule. In those forms with a silicious skeleton the
geometrical pattern conforms more or less to the shape of the central
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
capsule, being either spherical or conical. The central capsule is
regarded as being homologous with the calcareous shell of Globigerina.
Reproduction takes place by simple division into two, or by the body
breaking up into spores, each provided with a flagellum, or two
spores may fuse together, and the result will be an adult Radiolarian.
Certain yellow corpuscles present in the outer part of their body-surface
change into unicellular parasitic algals; these can be separated
and cultivated independently of their host. The Radiolarians live
floating at all depths from 1,000 to 2,500 fathoms, and are distributed
over areas in the central Pacific and the south-eastern part of the
Indian Ocean, the ooze forming the ocean bed being made up of
their skeletons to an extent of 80 per cent. of the deposit; hence
it has become known as Radiolarian ooze. The chalky-looking
Barbadoes earth, a Tertiary formation, is composed almost entirely
of their skeletons. Somewhat similar deposits exist in the Nicobar
Islands, in Greece, and in Sicily.</p>

<p>It will have been noticed that by far the greater number of
Foraminifera are of marine origin, and these occur in such widespread
profusion that the finest calcareous particles which constitute
the seashore in some places consist almost wholly of their microscopic
remains. At former periods of the earth’s history they appear
to have existed even in greater profusion than at the present time.
This is evidenced by their remains forming the principal constituent
of our largest geological formations.</p>

<p>Moreover, during the Canadian Geological Survey large masses of
what appeared to be a fossil organism were discovered in rocks
situated near the base of the Laurentian series of North America.
Sir William Dawson, of Montreal, referred these remains to an
animal of the foraminiferal type; and specimens were sent by
Sir W. Logan to the late Dr. Carpenter, requesting him to subject
them to a careful examination. As far back as 1858 Sir W. Logan
had suspected the existence of organic remains in specimens from the
Grand Calumet limestone, on the Ottawa River, but a casual examination
of the specimens was insufficient to determine the point.
Similar forms being seen by Sir W. Logan in blocks from the
Grenville bed of the Laurentian limestone were in their turn tried,
and ultimately revealed their true structure to Sir William Dawson
and Dr. Sterry Hunt, who named the structure <i>Eozoon Canadense</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span></p>

<p>The masses of which these fossils consist are composed of layers
of serpentine alternating with calc spar. It was found by these
observers that the calcareous layers represented the original shell,
and the silicious layers the softer parts of the once living Foraminifera.
The results were arrived at through comparison of the
appearance presented by the Eozoon with the microscopic structure
which Dr. Carpenter had previously shown to characterise certain
members of the Foraminifera. The Eozoon not only exceeded other
known Foraminifera in size to an extent that might have easily led
observers astray, but, from its apparently very irregular mode of
growth and general external form, no help was derived in its identification,
and it was only by microscopical examination of its minute
structure that its true character was ascertained. Dr. Carpenter
wrote:&mdash;“The minute structure of Eozoon may be determined by
the microscopic examination either of thin transparent sections, or of
portions which have been subjected to the action of dilute acids, so
as to remove the calcareous portion, leaving only the internal casts,
or models, in silex, of the chambers and other cavities originally
occupied by the substance of one animal.” Subsequently he found
portions of minute structure so perfect that he was able to say that
“delicate pseudopodial threads were originally put forth through
openings in the shell wall of less than <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10000</sub>th of an inch in
diameter” (<a href="#pl_iii">Plate III</a>., Nos. 64, 65). In a paper read at the meeting
of the Geological Society he stated that he had since detected Eozoon
in a specimen of ophicalcite from Bohemia, in a specimen of gneiss
from near Moldau, and in specimens of serpentine limestone sent to
Sir C. Lyell by Dr. G&uuml;mbel, of Bavaria. These also were found to be
parts of the great formation of the “fundamental” gneiss, considered
by Sir Roderick Murchison as the equivalent of the Laurentian rocks
of Canada.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p>If the remains of Foraminifera be dissolved in dilute hydrochloric
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
acid, an organic basis is left, after the removal of the calcareous
matter, accurately retaining the form of the shell with all its
openings and pores. The earthy constituent is mainly calcium
carbonate; but there is also a small amount of phosphate of lime
in the shells of many of them.</p>

<h3>Infusoria.</h3>

<p>We are now brought face to face with animals which possess
considerable variation of structure, <i>Infusorial animalcules</i>, as they
are termed. It was Ehrenberg who attributed to them a highly
complex organisation, but later observations negatived these views
and showed them to be animals formed of one or more cells, or
colonies of so-called individuals. It is true that this cell or united
protoplasm may show a wonderful amount of differentiation, what
with its nucleus and vacuole, mouth and gullet, its variously-arranged
cilia or flagella, its contractile fibres, its separation into
an outer denser and a more fluid inner protoplasm, and its horny
cup and stalks.</p>

<p>In these few lines we have a condensed summary of the special
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
qualities of minute forms of life that afford much interesting work
for the microscope.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_332" src="images/fig_332.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 332.&mdash;Acineta, magnified 600 diameters (<i>Warne</i>).</p></div>

<p>Among those widespread, and in some respects heterogeneous, forms
of life associated under the comprehensive title of Infusoria, we
encounter types that not only differ very widely from one another,
but which occupy a different rank or position, so to speak, with
regard to the relation they bear to each other, and also to the
outlying representatives of the series&mdash;differences that permeate
throughout the ranks of this extensive group. Furthermore, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
considerable number of Infusorial animalcules foreshadow or typify,
in a corresponding degree, the separate or associated cell elements
out of which higher tissue structures&mdash;metazoic organisms&mdash;are
built up. We may take the well-known example <i>Euglena viridis</i>
(<a href="#pl_iii">Plate III</a>., No. 67), or Paramecium (No. 74), and their allies;
these would appear to be the prototypes of Turbellaria. Another
more lowly organised group of the Ciliata exhibits a distinct and
highly-interesting affinity to the Opalinid&aelig;. There are many other
species (Acineta, <a href="#pl_iii">Plate III</a>., No. 68, for instance), which at first
sight would seem to stand by themselves and present no marked
agreement with any metazoic type. Indeed, the function of these and
other polypites consists simply in seizing food and conveying it through
perforations at the extremity of each separate tentaculum to its
interior. In Acineta certain of the tentacles only are suctorial, and
these, being the inner ones, fulfil the ingestive function, while the
peripheral series are prehensile. This stalked club-shaped body
(<a href="#fig_332">Fig. 332</a>), which fixes itself to seaweeds or Bryozoa, is seen to
have a nucleus, and also clear vesicles in the body-substance; its
embryos are ciliated. It is an object of considerable interest
even among curious marine animalcules; one or two species inhabit
fresh water. The spiral-mouthed Spirostomum are among the
largest of the class, and in sunlight are visible to the naked eye as
slender golden threads of about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>th of an inch in length. The
mouth slit, extending half the length of the body, is bordered on one
side by cilia. The body is cylindrical and the surface covered with
rows of cilia. Its multiplication takes place by transverse fission
through the middle.</p>

<p><i>Flagellate Infusoria.</i>&mdash;The characteristic of this group, as its
name implies, is the possession of one or more flagella or whip-like
appendages, at the base of which is an opening in the denser surface
layer of protoplasm, and in the interior a nucleus and one or more contractile
vacuoles, and not infrequently a brilliant red spot of pigment
known to microscopists as the eye-spot. The Monads, which constitute
the simplest members of the group, are commonly found in fresh-water
pools and vegetable infusions. The typical form consists simply of
a spherical or oval cell provided with a flagellum. The Volvox was
formerly placed in this group, but as it contains chlorophyll it
is properly claimed by the botanist. The collared group possesses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
cup-like collars, and these frequently secrete horny receptacles or
cups, and form elegant tree-like colonies.</p>

<p>The mail-coated group are of very varied form, the body being
often prolonged into spiny processes. They have two long flagella
which fit into grooves purposely provided. But the most interesting
and remarkable are the phosphorescent animalcules (Noctiluca),
whose beautiful bluish-green luminosity on the surface of the sea
has attracted attention from very early periods. It was, however,
not until the first half of the present century that the luminosity
was discovered to be due to the
presence of multitudes of these
minute jelly-like spheres.</p>

<div class="table">
<div style="width: 45%" class="tcell">

<img id="fig_334" src="images/fig_334.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 334.&mdash;Pyrocystis; magnified
150 diameters.</p></div></div>

<p>The body of the Noctiluca (<a href="#fig_333">Fig. 333</a>) is a nearly globular-shaped
cyst, enclosed in a tough membranous wall, from a grooved opening
in which a striated muscular flagellum or proboscis is projected forth,
and it is by means of this the animal swims away even in rough seas.
A fine whip-like flagellum is also located in the same groove. At the
apex of the funnel there is a mass of protoplasm which extends
itself as a widely-meshed, highly-vacuolated network to the inner
wall of the cyst, whence it is believed the phosphorescent light
emanates. It multiplies by self-division, first becoming encysted
after withdrawing its flagellum, and then breaking up into numerous
ciliated helmet-shaped swarm spores. Frequently two organisms fuse
into one and then divide into spores.</p>

<p>Noctiluca mainly confines itself to the shallower seas, but there
are related forms met with in the warmer open seas; these belong
to the genus Pyrocystis (<a href="#fig_334">Fig. 334</a>). In one variety the body is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
perfectly spherical and without the big flagellum or proboscis.
Professor Butschli, however, regards this species as an encysted
or resting phase of the commoner and better-known form.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Philip Gosse, F.R.S., was the first microscopist to
describe the Noctiluca. After careful observation, he wrote in his
“Naturalist’s Rambles” as follows:&mdash;“I had an opportunity of
becoming acquainted with the minute animals to which a great
portion of the luminousness of the sea is attributed. One of my
large glass vases of sea-water I had observed to become suddenly
at night, when tapped with the finger, studded with minute but
brilliant sparks at various points on the surface of the water. I
set the jar in the window, and was not long in discovering, without
the aid of a lens, a goodly number of the tiny jelly-like globules of
<i>Noctiluca miliaris</i> swimming about in various directions. They
swam with an even gliding motion, much resembling that of the
<i>Volvox globator</i> of our fresh-water pools. They congregated in little
groups, and a shake of the vessel sent them darting down from
the surface. It was not easy to keep them in view when seen, owing
rather to their extreme delicacy and colourless transparency than
to their minuteness. They were, in fact, distinctly appreciable by
the naked eye, measuring from <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>50</sub>th to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>30</sub>th of an inch in diameter.”</p>

<p>Among the numerous fresh-water members of the flagellate
infusoria, there is one which especially calls for notice, Codosiga,
discovered by the late Professor H. J. Clark. This minute body
bears a delicate funnel-shaped protoplasmic expansion or collar,
common to the several members of this organic series. The flagellum
is placed at the base of the oral opening, and within the circumscribed
area of the collar, which is of such extreme tenuity that its
true form and nature can only be determined by a very careful
adjustment of the achromatic condenser and accessory apparatus
employed, together with a wide-angled objective. It is seen to
greater advantage by supplying the animal with very fine particles of
colouring matter. In this way it is found that the infundibuliform
cup consists of protoplasm, through which the flagellum is protruded
and withdrawn into the general substance of the Monad’s body (Fig.
335). As many as twenty or more zooids are attached to the extremity
of a slender footstalk. The length of the body, exclusive of the
collar, is <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2500</sub>th to the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>1200</sub>th of an inch. The habitat of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
bodies is fresh water. Mr. Saville Kent in 1869 discovered some of
these interesting infusoria in the London Docks.</p>

<p>“The more exact significance of the special organ, the collar, is
manifest by the circulatory currents or cyclosis induced, and there can
be no room for doubt that this structure finds its precise homologue
in the pseudopodia of the foraminiferous group of the Rhizopoda,
in which a similar circulation or cyclosis of the constituent
sarcode is exhibited. The whole of this highly-interesting flagellate
order, a comparatively small one as yet, are remarkable for their
pale glaucous green or florescent hue, such colour assisting materially
in their recognition, even when the magnifying power employed is
insufficient for the detection of the very characteristic collar with its
enclosed flagellum.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p><i>Ciliata.</i>&mdash;Types of Ciliata obtained from hay infusions are very
numerous. Ehrenberg’s animalcules were mainly of a large size, and
of those belonging to the higher order of the Ciliata, pertaining to
such genera as Paramecium, Colpoda, Cyclidium, Oxytricha, and Vorticella.
These, however, represent but an insignificant minority of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
the hosts of flagellate forms which abound in our humid climate,
and in hay infusions in particular. In such infusions, watched from
day to day and produced from hay obtained from different localities,
the number of types developed in regular sequence is found
to be perfectly marvellous, commencing with the <i>Monas</i> proper,
Amphimonas and Heteromita; while Bacteria, in their motile and
quiescent forms, are invariably present and furnish an abundant
supply of material for the microscope.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>Vorticellid&aelig; constitute one of the most numerous families of the
ciliate infusoria. All its members are at once recognised by their
normal stationary condition, and by the structure of their oral
system. In but few of the genera is there any marked divergence
from this formula, and when any exists it is made manifest by an
increase in development of some one of its elements at the expense
of another. For instance, in the genus Spirochona, the external
edge of the encircling border or peristome is suppressed, while the
inner portion is abnormally developed into a transparent and highly
elevated spiral membrane. The bell-animalcules usually possess
stalks, and are either solitary or form branching colonies. <i>Conichilus
vorticella</i> (<a href="#pl_iii">Plate III</a>., No. 80) is a well-known member of the colony
stock, all the zooids of which are united on a slender branching
pedicle, which consists of a central contractile cord enclosed within
a tubular hyaline sheath. There are many other shrub-like colonies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
all variously modified in form and character. The <i>Epistylis opercularia</i>,
or nodding-bell animalcule, is an interesting member of a
numerous host of solitary short-stalked forms (<a href="#fig_337">Fig. 337</a>). When
the animal is disturbed, the heads drop down towards the stalk.
This animalcule has been found to form a colony; and another, Carchesium,
whose tiny branched tree-like colonies resemble little white
globular masses of moulds, are seen at once to drop down towards the
base of the colony with a jerky movement if the cell be touched.
By a process of encysting, all the Vorticell&aelig; and many of the more
highly-organised ciliata have the means of what may be termed
self-preservation. Should the water dry up in which they have
been living, the little animal encases itself in mud at the bottom
of the pool. Should this be baked by the sun not the least injury
arises, for at this stage it crumbles into dust,
and is carried by the wind to long distances,
but the first shower of rain calls it back to
active life, and soon after it is seen to issue
forth as a free swimming bud.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_336" src="images/fig_336.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 336.&mdash;<i>Vorticella
microstoma.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Thuricola valvata</i> (<a href="#pl_iii">Plate III</a>., No. 72) possesses
a hinge-like process which closes up like
a door when the animal contracts itself into its
case. This very effectually protects it from
assault. Both portions of the valve are capable
of extension. Another group of ciliate infusoria also possess a limited
number of cilia, but these, although restricted to the under surface of
their bodies, have an unrestricted range of motion. The group are
all free swimmers, belonging to the genus Oxytricha. They possess
two separate alimentary orifices, neither of which are situated at the
extremities or encased by a dense integument. Their locomotive
organs consist either of set&aelig;, vibratile cilia, or non-vibratile styles
or uncini, variously situated, and all serving to make these infusorial
animals very active (<a href="#pl_iii">Plate III</a>., Nos. 73 and 77). A typical species
is the mussel-animalcule (Stylonychia, <a href="#fig_338">Fig. 338</a>), common in all
infusions and pools of water. Its body is oval and flattened, and
about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub>th of an inch in length. At one end a funnel-shaped
depression or mouth, with a ciliated margin, leads to the inner part
of the body, in which are two oval bodies, a nucleus and a contractile
vacuole, which is seen to contract rhythmically. The creature can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>
also stalk along by means of its cilia or set&aelig;, and set up currents to
the mouth. <a href="#pl_iii">Plate III</a>., Nos. 70, 71, 72, 73, and 74, are types of
these interesting bodies.</p>

<p>Dr. Balbini believes a true sexual generation occurs among these
organisms, but, with the exception of the Paramecium, this has
not been seen to take place; even Gruber’s more recent investigations
appear to be inconclusive on this point. Conjugation,
however, it is said takes place among some attached forms, as
in the Stentors. These have been seen to put forth a bud from
the body base, and soon after become free swimming bodies. The
trumpet-animalcule (Stentor), a conspicuous member of the ciliata, is
comparatively large, being about the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>25</sub>th of an inch in length when
extended to the full size. It is usually found attached to the under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
sides of duckweed, and is continually changing its form from that of a
small knob when contracted, to the trumpet shape seen in <a href="#fig_339">Fig. 339</a>,
No. 6, when fully extended, and from which it derives its name. The
long cilia projected from the upper part form a spiral within the
margin of the open mouth leading to the digestive sac. A contractile
vacuole lies to the right of the oral opening. New individuals are
produced by the process of budding, and in the form of ciliated
embryos from the nucleus. Stentors are commonly met with in
fresh water, and are usually of a brilliant green colour. These little
bodies will bear cutting up: if only a fragment of the nucleus be
included in the section, the injury is soon repaired.</p>

<p><i>Rotifera</i>, or <i>Wheel-animalcules</i> (<a href="#fig_339">Fig. 339</a>).&mdash;In this group we
have a higher type of animal, with a more complex organisation than
those previously noticed. The great majority inhabit fresh water,
and are readily developed in hay infusions, in bog-moss, in house-top
gutters, everywhere if looked for after a shower of rain. The
rotating organs from which these fascinating animalcula derive
their name consist of two disc-like bodies whose margins are
fringed with rows of cilia, which create currents toward the oral
aperture, and which have given rise to the optical delusion of
rotating wheels. The disposition of the cilia is so arranged as to
bring food to the rotifer and conduct it to the mastax or digesting
apparatus&mdash;a muscular bulb moved by a series of muscles&mdash;the gastric
glands and stomach. The great transparency of the whole structure
permits of the animal economy being easily studied. The body
is covered with a horny envelope of two layers, and is divided into
segmental divisions, which slide into each other telescopic fashion.
Consequently, as the water dries up, the animal is for a long
time rendered indestructible and capable of resisting varying temperatures
and the action of caustic reagents.</p>

<p>Rotifers are oviparous, and their eggs are conspicuous and of three
kinds. The common soft-shelled eggs produce females, the smaller
and more spherical produce males. The ephippial, or summer
eggs, are often beset with spines or bosses; these have only a
membranous covering, and are hatched soon after they are laid, or
before leaving the ova sac. The male rotifer is but a third of the
length of the female, often without cilia, and appears to have no
alimentary tract; indeed, the only internal organ is a large sperm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
sac. Rotifers have been divided by Dr. Hudson and the late
Mr. Gosse in their charming work on these very interesting “Wheel-animalcules”
into four orders, according to their powers of locomotion,
as follows:&mdash;(1) Rhizota, the rooted; (2) Bdelloida, the
leech-like, that swim and creep like a leech; (3) Plo&iuml;ma, the sea-worthy,
that only swim with their ciliary wreath; (4) Scirtopoda,
the skippers, that swim with their cilia and skip with arthropodous
limbs. These, again, are subdivided into families. With such hardy
creatures as Philodina, Adineta, Brachionus, &amp;c., creatures to whom
extremes of cold, heat, and drought are the ordinary conditions of
life, nothing can be easier to keep going throughout the year.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
Mr. C. F. Rousselet, who has so thoroughly succeeded in mounting
Rotifers with their cilia fully extended, recently exhibited at one
of the evening meetings of the Royal Microscopical Society, London,
no less than four hundred specimens in a natural and perfect
condition, the nervous system being seen more clearly from its
successful staining throughout the body than in the living rotifer.</p>

<p>There is also a family of Rotatoria with a single rotatory organ,
disposed around the margin of the case. This comprises at present
a very small group. The Œcistes is a member of the family
(<a href="#pl_iii">Plate III</a>., No. 69). A single ciliary wreath leads to the alimentary
canal, and a pharyngeal bulb or mastax comprises the apparatus of
nutrition. The visual organs are red, as in other rotifers, and the
ovarium contains several ova, shown in No. 69. The envelope is
a gelatinous transparent sheath, into which the animalcule can withdraw
itself, its attachment to the bottom being by the end of the
foot-like tail. The most interesting among this genus are the
Floscularians. These creatures may undoubtedly be described as
among the most beautiful and interesting of infusorial animals.</p>

<p>The Stephanoceros, “crowned animalcule,” as it is termed, is
about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>36</sub>th of an inch in length, and enclosed in a transparent
cylindrical flexible case, beyond which it protrudes five long arms in
a graceful manner. These, touching at their points, give a form from
which it derives its name. These arms are furnished with several
rows of short cilia, which seize the food brought within their grasp
until it can be swallowed. In addition to the rotatory organs, they
have short flexible processes, or cornu, attached to the outside of
one or more of their lobes. The water vascular system consists of
two canals arising from a small pyriform contractile vesicle, situated
below the stomach. The ova, after leaving the ova sac, remain
quiescent until their cilia are developed. Floscularians, like
Melicertans, have a certain affinity in form with Vorticellians and
Stentors, and also with Campanulari&aelig;, among polypes. Their cilia
are less regular when in action than in other Rotatoria. When they
retreat into their transparent cells they appear to fold themselves
up. Their internal structure can be seen through the external case,
and ova are observed enclosed in an ova sac; when thrown off they
remain quiescent until the formation of their cilia. The whole
family furnish interesting objects for microscopic investigation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span></p>

<p><i>Melicerta ringens</i> (“beaded Melicerta”).&mdash;Of all the Melicerta, or
“horny floscularia,” this is the most beautiful. Its crystalline
body is enclosed in a pellucid covering, wider at the top than the
bottom, of a dark yellow or reddish-brown colour, which gradually
becomes encrusted by zones of a variety of shapes, cemented
together with a peculiar secretion that hardens in water. It derives
its name from these pellets, which have the appearance of rows of
beads. Mr. Gosse furnished an excellent account of the architectural
instincts of <i>Melicerta ringens</i>: “An animalcule so minute
as to be with difficulty appreciable by the naked eye, inhabiting
a tube composed of pellets, which it forms and lays one by one. It
is a mason who not only builds up his mansion brick by brick, but
makes his bricks as he goes on, from substances which he collects
around him, shaping them in a mould which he carries on his body.</p>

<p>“The pellets composing the case are very regularly placed in
position; in a fine specimen, about the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>30</sub>th of an inch in length,
when fully expanded, as many as fifteen longitudinal rows of pellets
were counted, which gave about thirty-two rows in all. As it
exposes itself more and more, suddenly two large rounded discs
are expanded, around which, at the same instant, a wreath of cilia
is seen performing surprising motions.</p>

<p>“On mixing carmine with the water, the course of the ciliary current
is readily traced, and forms a fine spectacle. The particles are
hurled round the margin of the disc, until they pass off in front
through the great sinus, between the larger petals. If the pigment
be abundant, the cloudy torrent for the most part rushes off, and
prevents our seeing what takes place; but if the atoms be few, we
see them swiftly glide along the facial surface, following the irregularities
of outline with beautiful precision, dash round the projecting
chin like a fleet of boats doubling a bold headland, and lodge themselves,
one after another, in the little cup-like receptacle beneath.
Mr. Gosse, believing that the pellets of the case might be prepared
in the cup-like receptacle, watched the animal, and presently had
the satisfaction of seeing it bend its head forward, as anticipated,
and after a second or two raise it again; the little cup having in the
meantime lost its contents. It immediately began to fill again; and
when it was full, and the contents were consolidated by rotation,
aided probably by the admixture of a salivary secretion, it was again
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
bent down to the margin of the case, and emptied of its pellet.
This process he saw repeated many times in succession, until a
goodly array of dark-red pellets were laid upon the yellowish-brown
ones, but very irregularly. After a certain number were deposited
in one part, the animal would suddenly turn itself round in its case,
and deposit some in another part. It took from two-and-a-half to
three-and-a-half minutes to make and deposit a pellet.”</p>

<p>Melicerta may be found in clear pools, mill-ponds, and other
places through which a current of water gently flows. If a portion
of water-weed be brought home and placed in a small glass zoophyte-trough,
and carefully examined with a magnifying power of about
fifty diameters, a few delicate-looking projections of a reddish-brown
colour will probably be seen adhering to the plant; these are the
tubular cases of Melicerta, which, after a short period of rest, will be
seen to be animals of <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub>th of an inch or more in length.</p>

<h3>Porifera. Spongiad&aelig;.</h3>

<p class="caption">Fig. 340.&mdash;<i>Spongia panicea.</i></p>

<p>Bread-crumb Sponge, showing
currents entering surface
<i>a</i>, and leaving by oscules <i>b</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>Sponges.</i>&mdash;The term Porifera, or “canal-bearing zoophytes,” was
applied by the late Dr. Grant to designate the remarkable class of
organisms known as sponges, met with
in every sea, and numbering about two
thousand species, varying in size from a
pin’s head to masses several feet in height;
and weighing from a few grains to over
a hundred pounds. Sponges assume an
endless variety of shapes, as cups, vases,
spheres, tubes, baskets, branched-like trees,
but often as shapeless masses. When
living they are all colours and all consistences,
soft and gelatinous, fleshy,
leathery or stony. A fuller knowledge
of sponges was gained in 1825, when Dr. Robert Grant examined
a fragment of living sponge under the microscope. On bringing
it to the side of the glass cell in which he had preserved it, he
beheld this living fountain pouring forth a torrent of liquid matter
in rapid succession, and he was at once convinced that a current
flowed out of the larger orifices. He introduced a small portion of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
fine chalk, and saw particles driven into the interior, and pass out
again by different ways. To determine the cause of the currents, it
was necessary to make a closer examination of the anatomy of the
sponge. For this purpose he cut or peeled off thin sections, and saw
that the whole substance was divided into flagellated chambers,
enclosing spherical and other bodies, and perforated by pores. Each
chamber proved to be about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>500</sub>th of an inch in diameter, groups
of them opening by a wider orifice into a common space, or canaliculus,
and joining others to form canals terminating in larger oscular
canals. The walls throughout are lined with flat cells, but in the
flagellated chambers the living cells are more or less cylindrical, and
each is provided at the free end with a whip-like appendage, or
flagellum. Furthermore
the upper margin was seen
to be expanded into a thin
hyaline collar, so that the
whip appeared to have its
origin in the centre of a
basin or funnel. The currents
of water traversing
the body of the sponge are
kept up by the movements
of the flagella of the
collar-cells. These beat
the water in the flagellated
chambers into the rootlets
of the canals leading to the oscules. To replace this, water flows
into the flagellated chambers from the rootlets of the canals passing
down from the groups of pores in the skin. The currents entering
the sponge bring in oxygenated sea-water and minute food particles,
such as diatoms and infusorial organisms; the currents from the
oscules contain an excess of carbonic acid of waste products, resulting
from vital activity and indigestible remains. The cells lining the
canals effect the exchange of gases, and take up food particles.</p>

<p>Professor Grant’s careful and instructive researches were begun on
the smaller kind of British sponges hanging down from rocks (<i>Spongia
coalita</i>), and on which he gazed for “twenty-five minutes, until
obliged to withdraw his eyes from fatigue.” This sponge fixes itself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
by a root; and the currents enter through the stem and body, and
leave principally by oscules placed on the branches.</p>

it assumes an amœboid form (Warne.)</p></div>

<p>At present too little is known as to the physiology of digestion in
sponges to permit of a definite statement on the subject. In specimens
fed upon carmine the collar-cells have been found loaded with
granules; in others, again, the flat cells lining the subdermal cavities
have been found gorged with colour granules. From Bowerbank’s
monograph on the British Spongiad&aelig; (1864 and 1874) nothing of
importance can be gained on
the subject; in fact, it relates
almost entirely to the structure
and organisation of
sponges in their dried or preserved
condition, and therefore
is only of value for
purposes of specific identification.
One of the simplest
of living sponges, the microscopic
structure of which it
is possible to trace, <i>Ascetta
primordialis</i>, is found on seaweeds
in the Mediterranean.
In its simple unbranched condition
it forms a minute white
sac about one twenty-fifth of
an inch in height, opening
above by a wide round oscule
and narrowing below to a stalk (<a href="#fig_342">Fig. 342</a>). The walls are very thin and
perforated by pores, through which the water passes into the interior.
The walls of the sac are composed of two layers, an inner lining
of collar-cells, and an outer layer consisting of a gelatinous matrix
containing amœboid bodies and transparent three-rayed spicules.
These serve to support the walls and as a frame-work for the pores,
as in all the sponges. By eliminating the spicular skeleton, and by
supposing the tube to be more globular, the “olynthus form” will
be obtained, which has been regarded as the hypothetical ancestor of
all sponges. A canal system arises when the walls grow thick or
form folds, or give off pouches or tubes. From these channels arise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
incipient in-current canals, between the inside or lumen of the folds
and that forming the out-current canal system.</p>

<p>There is a common ciliated Sycon found on seaweed round the
British coast; it has the appearance of a white sac about an inch in
height, with a crown of glassy spicules around the orifice. The
vertical cavity of the sac is surrounded by a wall of closely-packed
horizontal tubes, opening at their inner ends into the central cavity,
but externally ending blindly. The central cavity of the sac is surrounded
or lined with flat-cells, and the radial tubes with collar-cells,
and the walls of the tubes are perforated. Here the spaces between
and outside the densely-packed tubes are the in-current canals. In
an equally common British sponge, Grantia, which forms small flat
white bags, a rudimentary cortex covers the outer ends of the tubes.
In Grantiopois, the cortex becomes quite thick; as the radial tubes
in this species become more branched and the mesoderm thicker, so
the passages or in-current canals become more complicated. Common
silicious, sponges develop in a different manner from the calcareous
ones, namely, from a hollow conical sac open at the top and with a
flat base; the spherical flagellated chambers at a very early stage
forming a mammillated layer in the walls. Plakina, one of the
simplest silicious sponges, encrusts stones with a fleshy crust,
consisting of a sac with a flat base attached to the stone in sucker-like
fashion, and with the rest of the walls forming simple folds. The
spaces between and outside the folds form the in-current, and those
in the lumen of the folds the out-current, channels. Each of the
flagellated chambers in the walls of the folds communicates with
the in-current spaces through several pores, and opens into the out-current
spaces by one large pore, the currents of water passing
out by the central oscule. Here we have a general idea of the
formation of all the commoner forms of sponges. In the more
delicate species, as that of Venus’ flowerbasket, the cells are formed
by a trellis work of large spicules of silica. Groups of cells congregate
in the ground substance and secrete a network of cylindrical
fibres and spicules, which, although they remain to a certain extent
separate, are always beautifully adapted for purposes of support.
In addition to the support these afford, the skeleton spicules afford
a means of defence against the attacks of small animals.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span></p>

<p>A fairly good idea will be gained of the internal structure of
sponges from the section made of a <i>Geodia Barretti</i>, <a href="#fig_343">Fig. 343</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

of the intercellular spaces of the sponge; <i>f.</i> portion of the interstitial membrane
of sponge, crowded with minute stellate spicula; <i>g.</i> portions of the secondary
system of external defensive spicula.</p></div>

<p><i>Reproduction.</i>&mdash;As regards the modes of reproduction, both male
and female cells are found in the mesoderm. The male cells
generally give rise by division of the nucleus to masses of spermatozoa,
each of which possesses a conical head and a long vibratile
filament. The ova appear as large round cells, and when conglomerated
in masses, resemble those of Micro-gromia, which, after fertilisation,
undergo segmentation or division, first into two cells, and again
dividing and sub-dividing, until a cluster or mass of cells results (as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
seen in <a href="#fig_343">Fig. 343</a>). The outer layer of the egg-shaped embryo becomes
more cylindrical in shape, and is now provided with cilia, and soon
appears as an independent minute oval body. If a bread-crumb sponge
be cut open in the autumn, the embryos will be seen as bright yellow
spots within the body-substance. By keeping specimens in a vessel
of water, the embryos will be seen to escape from the oscules, and
swim freely about with the broad end forwards. After twenty-four
hours of independent existence, the embryo remains stationary, and
fixes itself by its broad end, which becomes flattened out. By a
remarkable transformation, the larger granular cells of the interior
burst out and grow over the outer flagellate layer of cells, and the
latter become the collar-cells of the adult sponge. A minute sponge
with one oscule results from the development of the fertilised ovum.
An extensive crust with numerous oscules may be regarded either
as a colony in which each oscule represents an individual, or simply
as one individual in which the growth of the body necessitates the
formation of new channels for the conveyance of food materials.
The embryos of some of the fresh-water sponges (Spongillid&aelig;) living
in ponds, canals, lakes and rivers all over the world, as soon as
they become fertilised undergo segmentation, and form oval ciliated
bodies, in appearance somewhat resembling the gastrula of Monoxenia,
one of the simplest kinds of corals. Fresh-water sponges are green
in colour, due to the granular bodies which crowd the cells near the
surface of the sponge; that this colour is not due to the formation
of chlorophyll is seen on keeping them in a shady place, when they
become pale grey or yellowish-brown, and if kept quite in the dark
they entirely lose all colour.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption">PLATE XVI.</p>
<img id="pl_xvi" src="images/pl_xvi.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SKELETONS AND SPICULA OF SPONGES.</p></div>

<p>A few sponges possess no skeleton whatever, excepting the
gelatinous ground substance; in some specimens the skeleton is
mainly or entirely composed of foreign particles of sand or the
remains of Foraminifera. Others are composed of calcium carbonate,
and form the class Calcarea, the spicules of which are white, and
opaque in mass; but on placing portions in hydrochloric acid, the
skeleton is dissolved away with effervescence, and the spicules are
left behind transparent and glassy. A great variety is seen in the
different species, as will be gathered from the few typical forms
shown in <a href="#pl_xvi">Plate XVI</a>., and which even in their fossilised state remain
unaltered, the silica which enters so largely into their composition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
being indestructible, the calcareous matter alone becoming separated
in exposure to the action of air, or by boiling in hydrochloric acid.
The only perceptible difference noticed is an increase in transparency,
and this, on mounting them in Canada balsam, adds to their beauty
when examined by polarised light.</p>

<p>Hyalonema, the “glass-rope” sponge of Japan, consists of a
bundle of from 200 to 300 threads of transparent silica, glistening
with a satiny lustre like the most brilliant spun glass; each thread
is about eighteen inches long, in the middle the thickness of a
knitting-needle, and gradually tapering towards either end to a fine
point; the whole bundle coiled like a strand of rope into a lengthened
spiral, the threads of the middle and lower portions remaining compactly
coiled by a permanent twist of the individual threads; the
upper portions of the coil frayed out, so that the glassy threads
stand separate from each other. The spicules on the outside of
the coil stretch its entire length, each taking about two and a half
turns of the spiral. One of these long needles is about one-third
of a line in diameter in the centre, gradually tapering towards
either end. The spirally-twisted portion of the needle occupies
rather more than the middle half of its entire length. In the
lower portion of the coil, which is embedded in the sponge, the
spicule becomes straight, and tapers down to an extreme tenuity,
ultimately becoming so fine that it is scarcely possible to trace it
to its termination.</p>

<p>Within the mesoderm, and in oscule, was noticed a deep brownish-orange
coloured shrunken membrane; this was traced to a parasitic
polyp. Since this was first observed on an early specimen of the
Japanese glass-sponge, the same parasite has always been found
growing on and in all these curious sponges. The surface of the
stalk above the portion embedded in the mud is seen to be covered
with a warty crust of parasitic polyps. All the specimens of
Hyalonema in the European museums in 1860 had their stalks
overgrown with Palythoa, while many had their bodies also
covered with another parasite, and which, fortunately for the sponge,
did not form a sandy crust. The polyps, having no skeleton,
dry up entirely, and leave behind no trace except the stain first
referred to. Unlike a parasite, however, the polyps do not feed
upon the juices and soft parts of the sponge, nor indeed do they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
share its food, but simply settle upon the sponge and feed upon
any food that may chance to come within their reach.</p>

<p>The dredgings of the <i>Challenger</i> brought to the surface many
entirely new forms of glass-sponges and from great depths. One
of the most beautiful, known as Carpenter’s glass-sponge (Pheronema),
is composed of concentric lamin&aelig; of silica deposited around a fine
central axial canal. These form a gauze-like network throughout,
but with no regularity of structure.</p>

<p><i>Clion&aelig;.</i>&mdash;Not the least wonderful circumstance connected with
the history of sponges is the power possessed by certain species of
boring into substances, the hardness of which might be considered
as a sufficient protection against such apparently contemptible foes.
Shells (both living and dead), coral, and even solid rocks are attacked
by these humble destroyers, gradually broken up, and, no doubt,
finally reduced to such a state as to render substances which would
otherwise remain dead and useless in the economy of nature available
for the supply of the necessities of other living creatures.</p>

<p>These boring sponges constitute the genus Cliona of Dr. Grant.
They are branched in form, or consist of lobes united by delicate
stems, and after having buried themselves in shells or other calcareous
objects, preserve their communication with the water by means
of perforations in the outer wall of the shell. The mechanism
by which a creature of so low a type of organisation contrives to
produce effects so remarkable is still doubtful, from the great difficulties
which lie in the way of coming to any satisfactory conclusions
upon the habits of an animal that works so completely in the dark
as the <i>Cliona celata</i>. Mr. Hancock, in his valuable memoir upon the
boring sponges, attributes their excavating power to the presence of
the multitude of minute silicious crystalline particles adhering to
the surface of the sponge; these he supposes are set in motion
by ciliary action. In whatever way this action may be produced,
however, there can be no doubt that these sponges are constantly
and silently effecting the disintegration of submarine calcareous
bodies&mdash;the shelly coverings, it may be, of animals far higher in
organisation, and in many instances they prove themselves formidable
enemies even to living molluscs, by boring completely through the
shell. In this case the animal whose domicile it so unceremoniously
invades has no alternative but to raise a wall of new shelly matter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
between himself and his unwelcome guest, and in this manner generally
succeeds in barring him out.</p>

<p>From a close examination of the structural and developmental
characters of the Spongide&aelig;, it must be conceded that they belong
rather to the flagellata Protozoa than to any other order. This
was the view held by the late Professor Clark, and Mr. Saville Kent
quite concurs in it.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> Summing up the entire evidence adduced,
scarcely a shadow of doubt is admissible concerning the intimate
relationship that subsists between the Choano-flagellata and other
flagellate Protozoa and that of sponges. The primary and essential
element of the apparently complex sponge stock is the assemblage
of collared flagellate zooids that inhabit its interstitial cavities under
various plans of distribution. Individually these collared zooids
correspond structurally and functionally in every detail with the
collared units of such genera as Codosiga, Salpingœca, and Proto-spongia.
The collar in either case presents the same structure and
functions, exhibits the same circulatory currents or cyclosis, and acts
in the same way for the capture of food. The body contains an
identical centrally located spheroidal nucleus or endoplast, and a
corresponding series of rhythmically pulsating contractile vesicles.
The developmental reproductive phenomena are also strictly parallel.
Both originate as simple Amœba or simple flagellate Monads, exhibiting
no trace in their earliest stage of the subsequently acquired
characteristic collar. Both again after a time withdraw their collar
and flagellum, and assume the amœboid state; then, coalescing, enter
upon a quiescent or encysted condition, and break up into a number
of sporular bodies, and thus provide for the further existence and
distribution of the species. The whole process again is much akin
to that which obtains in the protophytic type, <i>Volvox globator</i>,
which liberates from its interior free swimming gemmules that take
the form of spherical aggregation of biflagellate daughter-cells. In
their isolated state, on the other hand, the swarm gemmules of the
sponge stock are directly comparable with the free swimming subspheroidal
colony stock of the flagellate infusoria Synura, Syncrypta,
and Uroglena, or with the attached subspheroidal clusters of Codosiga
and Anthophysa.</p>

<h3>Zoophytes, Cœlenterata, Medus&aelig;, Corals, Hydrozoa.</h3>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_344" src="images/fig_344.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 344.&mdash;Gorgonia
Nobilis.</p></div>

<p>A study of the earliest growth of the Cœlenterata
has shown that their internal cavities are nothing
more than regular radiate out-growths of the
internal structures. The result of this development
is a condition which does not occur again in
the whole of the animal kingdom. There is a
system of cavities all in open communication one
with another, no closed blood vascular system,
and no specialised respiratory apparatus. Again,
all the animals that constitute this large group
are radiate in structure, that is, when viewed from
above they are typically star-shaped, and if cut
across, every horizontal section shows a symmetrical
arrangement of the several parts around
a centre. There are other radiate animals, as the
Echinoderms, but while in these five is the fundamental
number of rays, in the Cœlenterata the rays
are a multiple of four, six and upwards. The
skeleton or framework of each differs, and when
the Cœlenterata form calcareous structures, these
are quite different from the tests of the sea-urchins;
and in all cases the anterior portion of
the body is crowned with one or more circles
of tentacles, which remain perfectly flexible and
flower-like. The most highly-developed of the
free forms are the sea-anemones and the jelly-fish.
These have no hard or calcareous skeleton whatever,
but withal they are, in the opinion of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
naturalists and microscopists, the most beautiful objects among
Zoophytes.</p>

<p>In spite of their variety of forms, the Cœlenterata seem to be as
incapable of higher development as do the Echinoderms, and they
have failed to make headway in fresh water, but it is not improbable
that some of the simplest forms of the whole group may have given
rise to higher animal forms, while the sea anemones, corals, &amp;c.,
being those descendants of the primitive simple form, have retained
the original type of organization almost unchanged.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_345" src="images/fig_345.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 345.&mdash;<i>Hydra viridis</i>, adhering to a stalk of <i>Anacharis alsinastrum</i>.</p></div>

<p>The type of the group is the Hydra, a fresh-water polyp, commonly
found attached to the leaves and stems of many aquatic
plants, or floating pieces of stick. Two species are well known to
microscopists, the <i>H. viridis</i>, or green polyp, and the <i>H. vulgaris</i>,
somewhat darker in colour, probably dependent upon the nature of
its food. The third, less common species, the <i>H. fasca</i>, is distinguished
from both by the length of its tentacles, which, when fully extended,
greatly exceed those of either of the before-mentioned. The fresh-water
group measures from one-eighth to the one-third of an inch in
length, and form simple stocks of one, two or more branches. They
almost exactly resemble in form the polyps of the Hydractinia, which
are provided with a circle of tentacles. When placed in a vessel of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>
water and left undisturbed they often attach themselves to the side,
where they may be examined with a moderate power at leisure.
They are then seen to spread out their tentacles like fine threads,
and seize upon any small creature that may come in their way, and
by the same means convey it to a mouth capable of great extension.
All Hydra possess stinging-cells, by means of which they paralyse
their prey. Many Hydra attain to a large size, and shoot out long
poisonous filaments; they also possess smaller kinds of smooth cells,
which appear to be employed for an entirely different purpose,
but for what is not positively known. Hydra usually multiply
by means of buds, an out-growth from the body, and these remain
attached to the mother stalk for some time, often long enough to
give rise to one or two smaller buds. Single eggs are also developed
in the ectoderm beneath capsules, or wart-like prominences. The
adult animal can be cut to pieces, and from each piece a new individual
will be developed. This method of reproduction was first tried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
by the naturalist Trembley in 1739, whose experiments in this
direction excited the greatest interest among the naturalists of the
middle of the last century. <i>Hydra fusca</i> in various stages of
development is given in outline in <a href="#fig_346">Fig. 346</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>In the polyps belonging to this family the body-structure for
the most part consists of a homogeneous aggregation of vesicular
granules, held together by an intercellular sarcode, and capable of
great extension and contraction, so that these animals can assume
a variety of forms and extend their body and tentacles until the
latter become almost invisible. It was the resemblance in this
respect to the fabled Hydra that originated the name. Its organ of
prehension is termed the <i>hasta</i>; this consists of a sac or opening
at the terminal end of the tentacle, within which is seen a saucer-shaped
vesicle, supporting a minute ovate body, which carries a
sharp calcareous piece termed a <i>sagitta</i> or arrow. Although the
fresh-water Hydra may be regarded as typical of this group of
animals, marine fauna furnish a far more extensive group in the
corals, jelly-fish, and sea-anemones.</p>

<p>A smaller group, the Ctenophora, although members of this
sub-kingdom, have not yet found their true position; nevertheless
they are interesting glassy, transparent creatures, either shaped like
apples, melons, or Phrygian caps, or else forming bands of some
considerable length; all are wonderfully transparent, with the
single exception of the Bero&euml;. These inhabit the open sea, and are
only seen inshore when driven in by currents or strong winds.
Their position in the water is usually more or less vertical, the
mouth being turned downwards. The portion from which this group
derives its name is the ribs, which are symmetrically arranged,
and consist of rows of short transverse combs, each forming rows of
cilia, which, as they wave to and fro, constitute a swimming or
rowing plate, their activity in the water depending upon the will
of the animal. They are also provided with an oral umbrella, and
capturing filaments or tentacles with hair-like branches. These
tentacles, attached to the sides of the animal, are capable of erection
or withdrawal into pockets. Great variety is seen in these accessory
organs of locomotion; for instance, the Cydippid&aelig; (<a href="#pl_xvii">Plate XVII</a>.) have
only arms, but these are remarkable for their length, and serve for
the purpose of capturing food as well as for steering. The most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
interesting, if not the most beautiful of the Ctenophora, are the
Beroid&aelig;; it is this family that bear a resemblance to the Phrygian
cap (<a href="#pl_xvii">Plate XVII</a>., <i>e</i>). The mouth is wide, but it appears to have no
capturing tentacles, and yet their habits are carnivorous; they will
even devour their own relations. Many of the genus are phosphorescent,
and in place of stinging-cells have small spherical knobs
beset with sticky globules, in which their food becomes entangled,
and these are apparently in constant use.</p>

<p><i>The Stinging Series</i>, <i>Cnidaria</i>, comprise sea-anemones, corals,
jelly-fish among marine animals, and Hydra among the fresh-water
Cœlenterata; and derive their name from a remarkably curious
feature, the so-called stinging capsules. These are not only offensive,
but also defensive weapons with all the animals belonging to
this group; the possession of which has converted the bell-like jelly-fish
into a simple Cnidarian. The principal change is in the gelatinous
layer between the outer wall and the inner digesting layer of the
ectoderm. But without entering further into their structure and
relations, the stinging-cells and batteries claim especial attention.
These cells vary considerably in size without their characteristics being
essentially changed. The protoplasm of the cell is modified into
a tolerably firm substance, enclosing an oval or cylindrical vesicle.
Closely associated with this is a pointed process, standing up far
above the level of the outer covering, known as the <i>cnidocil</i>. Within
the vesicle is found, either spirally rolled up or in an irregular tangle,
a long filament or hollow tube, a prolongation of the vesicle, but
turned outside in. This tube is more than twenty times as long as
the cell, is pointed at the tip, and beset with two rows of fine spirally-arranged
barbed hooks. When the cnidocil is touched or irritated,
this filament is violently shot out, being then turned inside-out, like
the fingers of a glove. So long as the thread remains rolled up
within the vesicle the barbed hooks remain in their tube, but when
shot out, they change to the outside. The rolled-up filament appears
to be filled with some poisonous material, which is ejected when the
tube is shot out, and where the point strikes a wound is inflicted,
so that unless the prey is stronger than the attacker it cannot
escape. The greater the struggle, the larger the number of capsules
discharged in order to kill.</p>

<p><i>Polypomedus&aelig;.</i>&mdash;Among the higher development of the stinging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
group is the jelly-fish. The Siphonophora, as represented by the
Portuguese man-of-war, are in their turn the highest development of
swimming-bells, and exhibit many modifications and combinations
of individuals. The tentacles of the Physalia, the best known, are
stiff with batteries of stinging-capsules, the sting of which is more
like the shock of the electric current. The <i>Challenger</i> soundings
brought to light some remarkably
interesting forms, and these have
furnished much work for the microscope,
as all their larval forms are
extremely curious. Among the Hydromedus&aelig;
there are many different life
histories. Take the jelly-fish, the eggs
of which have given up forming stocks,
and are hatched out at once as Medus&aelig;.
There are others, the eggs of which
form stocks; others, again, in which
the sexual individuals do not swim
away as jelly-fish. The last were at
one time described under a new name,
because of one or two curious forms
being taken creeping on the ground.
This creeping Medusa (<i>Clavatella prolifera</i>)
has six arms, the tips of which
are provided with true suckers, and on
these it walks as on stilts, while from
each arm a short stalk arises, the
swollen end of which is beset with
stinging capsules. It has an extensile mouth-tube, and feeds upon
small crustaceans found on seaweeds.</p>

<p>Among the forms that swim away as jelly-fish a very curious
example is presented in <i>Corymorpha mutans</i>. These swim about for
a time, and then firmly attach themselves by numerous thread-like
appendages, forced into the sand, and where the young prepare
for their next metamorphosis. As an example of the stocks of
those representatives which do not swim away as jelly-fish, take
the beautifully-feathered, plant-like creatures found erect along
the seashore, the Sertularia (<a href="#fig_358">Fig. 358</a>, No. 12) and Plumularia.

<p>In addition to the nutritive individuals, there are the egg-bearing;
these do not become free-swimming individuals. One small family
is neither branched nor feathered&mdash;the <i>Hydractinia echinata</i>, found
in the North Sea and on the Norwegian coasts, where it attaches itself
to the shells of gastropods, selecting those inhabited by hermit
crabs. The part of the stock common to all the individuals is the
skin-like portion which adheres to the surface of the shell. In some
spiny processes are produced, and the nutritive canals running down
the stems of the polyps are continued into the membrane belonging
to the stock, as seen in <a href="#fig_349">Fig. 349</a>.</p>

<p>The nutritive individuals are distinguished by
long tentacles, mouths, and digestive canals.
The females have no mouths, and are supplied
with food through the system of canals running
to them from the nutritive males. These reproductive
members are furnished with stinging
threads instead of tentacles for the protection of
their ova. The ciliated larv&aelig;, in a very short
time, swim off to found new colonies.</p>

<img id="fig_350" src="images/fig_350.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 350.&mdash;Medus&aelig;,
Jelly-fish.</p></div>

<p>The free-swimming jelly-fish (<a href="#fig_350">Fig. 350</a>, and Plate
XVII., <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>) belong to the order Scyphomedus&aelig;.
These are characterised by their delicate
colouring, and from the arrangement of their nervous system, which
can only be made out by staining. Some new and curious forms
were dredged from a depth of more than 6,000 feet off the coast of
New Zealand, varying in size from an inch to twenty inches; many
having from four to eight or ten eyes arranged along the margin.</p>

<p><i>Anthozoa.</i>&mdash;From the free-swimming we turn to a group of permanently
fixed polyp forms, the sea-anemones and corals. The
development of Monoxenia commences with the egg, repeatedly
dividing into many parts (<a href="#fig_351">Fig. 351</a>, <small>C</small>, <small>D</small>, and <small>E</small>), by a process
common to the animal kingdom, termed egg-segmentation, in this
particular instance proceeding from an apparently hollow sphere, <small>A</small>,
enclosing a single layer of cells, <small>G</small>. Each cell sends out a long cilia,
or whip-like process, <i><small>F</small></i>, by means of which the larva turns about and
swims in the body fluid of the parent polyp. One half of the sphere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
now becomes enfolded into the other half, <small>H</small>, and forms what is
termed a <i>gastrula</i>, <small>I</small>, <small>K</small>. The gastrula stage of Monoxenia is of the
simplest kind, the larva forming a sac, with walls consisting of two
layers, an outer, or ectoderm, and an inner, or endoderm. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>
transition from the flat dish shape, <small>H</small>, to the sac with a narrow
mouth is at once clear, and the knowledge that all the Cœlenterates
proceed from similar larv&aelig;, and that all the complications of their
various systems are developed from a simple gastrula, throws much
light on their anatomy. During these transitions the endoderm,
whose cells multiply, continues as an uninterrupted lining to the
stomach and its appendages, while the ectoderm yields the cuticular
elements.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_351" src="images/fig_351.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 351.&mdash;Stages in development of <i>Monoxenia Darwinii</i>,
&times; 600.&mdash;(Warne.)</p></div>

<p>A third intermediate gelatinous layer, the <i>mesogl&aelig;a</i>, arises between
the two layers in which muscles and connective interstitial tissue
appear. In the mesogl&aelig;a of one species of coral calcification takes
place; this internal calcification has but a small share in the work
of the great rock-making corals, their most important calcification
being external. In Monoxenia, although the transition from the
gastrula larva to the adult animal has not been seen, there can be no
doubt as to how this is carried out, the transformations having been
watched throughout in other species. The larva attaches itself with
the end opposite the mouth, the cilia disappear, and after the
mouth-tube has been formed by the folding in of the anterior end
along the longitudinal axis of the body, and has thus become marked
off from the stomach, eight hollow tentacles rise round the mouth
as outgrowths of the body cavity, or as direct continuations of the
stomach.</p>

<p>Like all other corals, Monoxenia periodically multiply by means
of eggs, which are formed either in the walls of the radiating
partitions or septa, or along the free edges. These are ejected
through the oral opening. As a rule, the polyps are either male
or female; but in stock-forming species individuals of the two sexes
are often mixed. Monoxenia may be taken as the simplest type
of the regularly radiate polyps; in all the different organs being
repeated in regular rings round a central axis; the mouth also is
circular. From this interesting account, drawn by Haeckel, of a
simple polyp, it will be at once seen what kind of radiate animal it is
that builds up the coral reefs. “No garden on earth can match the
gardens of the sea that circle the northern part of Australia. As the
tide ebbs in azure sunset, coral-reefs peer out symmetrically arranged
in beds and intersected by emerald pathways coursing through corals
of all hues and tints fathoms deep in the channels.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span></p>

<p>In a growing polyp-stock the individuals usually remain in
organic connection; that is to say, each first provides for itself and
then shares its superfluity with others, sometimes by means of a
continuous reticulated system of canals perforating the calcareous
substance which often separates the members of one stock from
another. The whole colony may thus be physiologically one creature
with many mouths. There are others that remain single, as
the inverted pyramidal-looking bodies, Fungid&aelig;, commonly called
“Sea-mushrooms,” found in great variety. The colour of the polypidom
is white, of a flattened round shape, made up of thin plates
or scales, imbedded in a translucent jelly-like substance, and within
is concealed a polyp; the footstalk, by means of which the animal
is attached to the rock, is of a calcareous nature (<a href="#fig_352">Fig. 352</a>,
No. 1).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_352" src="images/fig_352.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 352.&mdash;Sea-Anemones.</p>

<p>1. <i>Actinia rubra</i>, tentacles displayed and retracted; 2. <i>Heticictis bellis</i>;
3. <i>H. bellis</i>, seen from above.</p></div>

<p><i>Hexactinia</i> (six-rayed polyps) are not limited to six rays, as the
name given them may seem to imply; they are, in fact, very
numerous in some of the largest and most gorgeous of the sea-anemones.
All are distinguished by their solitary manner of life,
their size, and their vivid and variedly beautiful colouring. The
endoderm is firm, and when the animal withdraws its tentacles and
shuts its body substance in, there is some difficulty in penetrating
to the interior. It does not, however, secrete a calcareous skeleton
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>
inside or out, as do the true coral polyps. Among the Hexactinia
the sea-anemone (<a href="#fig_352">Fig. 352</a>) takes the first place.</p>

<p>These beautifully coloured creatures are, for the most part, found
attached to the spot selected by the larv&aelig;; a few species bore into
the sand with the posterior part of the body, or build a sheath,
which they inhabit. They are voracious feeders, and devour large
pieces of flesh, and even mussel and oysters, sucking them in by
means of their long grasping tentacles. Well-fed anemones change
their skin frequently, during which process they remain closely
retracted; the shed skin forms a loose girdle around the base. <i>Actinia
bellis</i> not infrequently attach themselves to the shells of crabs and
whelks, and are thus carried to pastures new.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_353" src="images/fig_353.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 353.&mdash;Larv&aelig; of Sea-Anemones, <i>Actinia effœta</i>, highly magnified.</p></div>

<p>On account of the ease with which anemones are kept in captivity,
their mode of reproduction can be closely observed. With but few
exceptions they develop from eggs, and in the course of a few
weeks are hatched into ciliated infusorial larv&aelig;, presenting most
curious and exquisite representations of jugs and jars, with cover
lids (as seen in <a href="#fig_353">Fig. 353</a>, <i>Actinia effœta</i>). These evince the handiwork
of a master hand in the ceramic art. They are, however,
of so translucent a nature as to permit of the internal structure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>
being seen to consist of nerves and vessels, and which are rendered
more apparent by staining. These settle down in a week or ten
days, and then shed their cilia, the first tentacle appearing during
the process of attachment.</p>

<p>In some species the young Actini&aelig; are seen to pass through their
whole development within the body cavity of the parent. Most
anemones are provided with several circles of more or less cylindrical
tentacles, and there are a few specially beautiful species which,
besides tentacles of the usual form, have, either within or without
the ordinary circle of tentacles, lobed or leaf-like tactile and seizing
organs. These belong to the family of the beautiful Crambactis
of the Red Sea. Below these grasping tentacles comes a circle of
thicker arms unlike the former, being spindle shaped. All the
tentacles of the sea-anemones are hollow with a fine aperture at the
tip, through which, on closing rapidly, it is seen to expel a jet
of water.</p>

<p><i>True Corals.</i>&mdash;It will have been noticed in the foregoing remarks
that in the soft body-division of the Hexactinia there are both
single individuals and colonies joined together to form stocks. The
same diversity in this respect will be found among corals proper,
with this difference, that the skeleton-forming polyps, by combining,
build up substantial structures in the most secure and advantageous
positions. Now it so happens that all the corals found about our
coasts are generally small and solitary dwellers, one of the best
known of which is the scarlet crisp coral, Flabellum, and is characterised
by the slit-like form of the mouth. Viewed sideways
it resembles a small fan fastened along the edges, and just inside a
row of fully developed tentacles is seen protruding. An interesting
form of budding occurs in these corals: the buds fall off, and in this
budding condition the coral might pass, and indeed has been
described as a different species of Flabellum. The colour of the
coral is a beautifully transparent red. Remarkable as the solitary
corals are, they are surpassed both in number and in form by those
which form compound stocks, that is to say, in which the buds do
not fall off, but go on building up coral islands and barrier reefs in
the warmer seas. Some very few typical forms only are given in the
group accompanying, shown in <a href="#fig_358">Fig. 358</a>.</p>

<p>A different kind of stock is developed in a number of forms,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>
some producing many buds, as in the Madrepores, in which selected
polyps spring up above the rest, their sides also becoming covered
with small buds, each one of which is a living, feeding, coral
animal surrounded by a crown of tentacles. These Madrepores
play a very important part in the building up of coral reefs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_354" src="images/fig_354.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 354. Developmental stages of Larv&aelig;, <i>Astroides calycularis</i>, &times; 40.</p></div>

<p>Another massive coral, the <i>Astroides calycularis</i>, has a different
mode of growth, the tubes not being fused together. When
seen standing out these yellowish-red polyps have been mistaken
for small anemones. The larv&aelig; of this coral leave the
egg while still in the large chambered body cavity of the parent,
where they swim about for a time, till they escape through the
mouth. They are worm-like in form, and swim by means of cilia,
which are thicker at the foremost end. The mouth first appears
after leaving the parent, but as they soon become exhausted by
the effort they assume a contracted form, and attach themselves, as
do anemones, by pressing the thicker end of the body against
a rock, the whole contracting into a thick round disc, while longitudinal
furrows become visible at the upper part where the mouth
sinks in. At the end of these furrows twelve tentacles appear.
The accompanying illustration shows the various stages through
which the larv&aelig; pass in rapid succession (<a href="#fig_354">Fig. 354</a>); at the same
time it has already commenced to secrete its calcareous skeleton.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span>
This is not formed as a connected whole but from a number of
separate centres of secretion formed between the polyp and the
substance to which it has attached itself, and which become gradually
fused into a perfect skeleton. A
section of the polyp at this stage
forms an interesting microscopical
object.</p>

<p>The so-called eight-rayed corals
consist of the one genus Tubipora,
the members of which are few in
number and not varied in form (Fig.
358, No. 10). In the structure,
however, of skeletons they are unique
among extant corals. Each individual
secretes a smooth-walled tube
without calcification of the vertical
septa. These tubes, like the pipes
of an organ, stand almost parallel,
and are united to form a stock by
means of transverse platforms. The
formation of buds does not appear
to take place in this family.</p>

<p>Another of the eight-rayed corals
is Gorgoniid&aelig;. These are permanently
fixed to the spot on which
they are found, and form a bush-like
growth, giving no idea of the
living coral, as it rises in graceful
branching colonies, in deep water,
and represents a portion of <i>Gorgonia
nobilis</i> with polyps expanded (Figs.
344 and 358, No. 9).</p>

<p>Other corals present numerous other departures from the types
we have been considering, but so far modified in form as that of the
Sea-pen, Veretillum (<a href="#fig_355">Fig. 355</a>), the stock part of which is surrounded
by polyps continued down a portion of the cylindrical stalk. The best
known of the species is <i>Pennatula phosphorea</i> of the Mediterranean.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p class="caption">Fig. 355.</p>

<p>1. <i>Pennatula phosphorea</i>; 2.
<i>Synapta chirodata</i>; 3. Anchor-shaped
spiculum and plate from

<p><i>Pennatulid&aelig;.</i>&mdash;This family derives its name from <i>penna</i>, a quill.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>
Their spicula also resemble a penholder in appearance, shown
in <a href="#fig_358">Fig. 358</a>, No. 3. The polyps are without colour, provided with
eight rather long retractile tentacula, beautifully ciliated on the
inner aspect with two series of short processes, and strengthened by
these crystalline spicula, a row being carried up the stalk, together
with a series of ciliated processes. The mouth, occupying the
centre of the tentacula, is somewhat angular. The ova lie between
the membranous part of the pinn&aelig;; these are globular, of a
yellowish colour, and by pressure can be made to pass through
the mouth. Dr. Grant wrote:&mdash;“A more singular and beautiful
spectacle could scarcely be conceived than that of a deep purple
<i>Pennatula phosphorea</i>, with all its delicate transparent polyps
expanded and emitting their usual brilliant phosphorescent light,
sailing through the still and dark abyss, by the regular and
synchronous pulsations of the minute fringed arms of the polyps.”</p>

<p>The spicula are seen to be a continuous series of cones fitting
into each other.</p>

<h3>Bryozoa, Moss-animals.</h3>

<p>The exact position in which the Bryozoa, or moss-animals, should
be placed in the animal kingdom has not been finally determined.
They were at one time associated with corals; then with sponges;
but, on further acquaintance, it became evident that they did not
belong to either. Naturalists also claimed them as Rotifers and
Ciliata, but this claim met with no better reception. Since they
appear to have no settled classification, there can be no objection to
linking them once more to corals, as they apparently resemble
these animals by always living in colonies, the individual members
of which are joined in a number of different ways to form stocks,
the individuals themselves, however, being very much smaller than
those of corals proper. The advantage is that the structure of the
Bryozoans can be more readily studied, as many of them live in
transparent chambers or cells, the walls of which, although somewhat
firmly agglutinated together, are flexible enough to fold up, as the
animals instantly withdraw their bodies and close up the top on the
slightest alarm (<a href="#fig_356">Fig. 356</a>).</p>

<p class="hang">Fig. 357.&mdash;Sea-moss, Flustra, the
body having been withdrawn
from its cell.</p></div></div>

<p>The general structure of the Bryozoan individual, figured attached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>
by its footstalk to a stem of wood, consists of a mouth at the
anterior part of the body opening into a muscular pharynx in
the alimentary canal, together occupying a considerable amount
of space. The terminal portion turns upon itself towards the oral
opening, its chief attachment being a short strand of tissue termed
the funiculus (shown in <a href="#fig_358">Fig. 358</a>, No. 11). In all adults two masses
of cells are found attached to the wall of the chamber; the upper
yields the eggs, within the lower the male elements are developed.
Moss-animals are hermaphrodite, fertilisation
being effected by the two elements
mingling together in the body
fluid. These are the essential points in
the structure of the whole seventeen
hundred species. Among the larger colonies a number of fresh-water
genera are found attached to the roots and branches of aquatic
plants, most of which, however, are inconspicuous. The beauty of
these minute bodies can only be seen under the microscope. Many
consist of delicate branching growths, the Sea-mats (Flustra), for
instance; others again appear as attractive lace corals, between the
open meshes of which multitudes of minute apertures crowned with
tentacles are displayed. The several individuals of the genus Lepralia
are arranged in rows, and further distinguished by the animals
being developed only on one side of the stock. The marvellous
variety of forms presented by these small animals is in a measure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span>
determined by the particular manner of their buddings. The greater
number of fresh-water moss-animals belong to the order Phylactol&aelig;mata,
so called because the mouth is provided with a tongue-shaped
lid. The crown of tentacles is furnished with rows of cilia,
and is horseshoe-shaped, the whole being surrounded at its base by an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>
integument forming a kind of cup, which is either soft or horny.
Those belonging to the wandering types (Cristatella, <a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>., Nos.
95-98) form flattened elliptical colonies, some of which creep
or move about on a kind of foot. A nervous system pervades the
mass of polyps, while in each separate polyp a nerve ganglion is
seen to be situated between the œsophagus and the posterior part
of the alimentary canal. The colony nerve
system regulates the movements of the
stock.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 359.</p>

<p>1. <i>Coryne stauridia</i>; 2.
A tentacle detached and
magnified 200 diameters.</p></div>

<p>There are many beautifully formed freshwater
polyps deserving of more than a
passing notice, as the slender Coryne
(<i>Coryne stauridia</i>), found adhering to the
footstalk of a <i>Rhodymenia</i> (<a href="#fig_359">Fig. 359</a>),
about which it creeps in the form of a
white thread. On placing both under the
microscope, the thread-like body of the
little animal appears cylindrical and tubular,
perfectly transparent, and permeated
by a central core, apparently cellular in
texture, hollow, and within which a rather
slow circulation of globules is perceived.
The parent Coryne sends off numerous
branches, the terminal head of which is
oblong, cylindrical, and at the extreme
end there are arranged four tentacles, long
and slender, each being furnished with a
nodular head. A magnified view of one
detached is shown erect (<a href="#fig_359">Fig. 359</a>, No. 2).
This polyp is much infested by parasites, vorticella growing on it
in immense numbers, forming aggregated clusters here and there,
individuals of the parasitic colony adhering to each other, and
projecting outwards in every direction.</p>

<p>Alcyonella, another fresh-water polyp, is found in the autumn
of the year in all the London Docks adhering to pieces of floating
timber. <i>A. stagnorum</i> partakes of the character of a sponge
rather than that of a polyp. It is usually found in gelatinous
colonies, and when stood aside for a short time these put forth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span>
a number of ciliated tentacles (shown in <a href="#fig_360">Fig. 360</a>, magnified 100
diameters).</p>

<p>The ova contained within the sac, and viewed by transmitted
light, appear as opaque spheres surrounded by a thin transparent
margin; these increase in thickness as the ova is developed, and
such of the ova as lie in contact seem to unite and form a statoblast.
A rapid current in the water around each animal, drawing with it loose
particles and floating animalcules, is seen moving with some velocity
as in other ciliated bodies; and a zone of very minute vibrating
cilia surrounds the transparent margin
of each tentacle.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_360" src="images/fig_360.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 360.&mdash;<i>Alcyonella fluviatella.</i></p></div>

<p>Dr. Percival Wright discovered on
the western coast of Ireland a new
genus of Alcyonid&aelig;, which he named
after the well-known naturalist Harte,
<i>Hartea elegans</i> (<a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>., No. 86).
This polyp is solitary, the body cylindrical,
and fixed by its base to the
rock; it has eight ciliated tentacles,
which are knobbed at their base and
most freely displayed. It is a very
beautiful polyzoon of a clear white
colour, and when fully expanded
stands three-quarters of an inch high.</p>

<p><i>Lophopus crystallinus</i> (<a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>.,
No. 98) displays beautiful plumes of tentacles arranged in a double
horseshoe-shaped series. When first observed these polyps resemble
in many respects masses of the water snail ova, for which they are
often mistaken. On placing these jelly-like masses into a glass
trough with some of the clear water taken from the stream in which
they are found, delicate tubes are seen to cautiously protrude, and
the beautiful fringes of cilia are quickly brought into play. The organisation
of <i>L. crystallinus</i> is simple, although it is provided with organs
of digestion, circulation, respiration, and generation. The nervous<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>
and muscular systems are well developed. This polyp increases
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>
both by budding and by ova, both of which conditions are shown in
<a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>., No. 98. The ova are enclosed in the transparent case
of the parent. In Lophopus and some other fresh-water genera,
Cristatella, Plumatella, and Alcyonella, the neural margin of the
Lophopore is extended into two triangular arms, giving it the
appearance of a deep crescent.</p>

<p>Another family presents a contrast: there is no lid to the mouth,
and the tentacles are arranged in a circle on a disc. An important
rise in organisation is found in the Gymnol&aelig;mata, especially in the
lip-mouthed forms; the individuals belonging to this order vary
in structure and fulfil different physiological functions. There are
structures known as zo&aelig;cia, stolons, avicularia, vibracula, and
ovicells, some of which are merely modified individuals. The zo&aelig;cia
are the normal individuals of the colony, fully developed for
most of the functions of life; the stolons have a much humbler
function, but are indispensable&mdash;they are the root-like outgrowths of
the stock, and serve for attaching the colony to foreign objects.
The most remarkable are those known as <i>avicularia</i>, so called
because they resemble the head of a bird. This process acts as
a pair of forceps, the large upper blade of which is very like the
skull and upper jaw of a bird, and the smaller lower blade (like
the lower jaw) constantly opens and shuts by means of a complicated
arrangement of muscles (shown in <a href="#fig_361">Fig. 361</a>). These avicularia are
movably attached by short muscles to the neck, and are found near
the entrance to a zo&aelig;cium. They turn from side to side, snapping
in all directions, catching at every particle of food that may
come near; at length the morsel is drawn into the mouth by the
cilia on the tentacles. From this very peculiar structure the
Chilostomata were originally named bird’s-head corallines, then
specifically shepherd’s-purse corallines, <i>Notamia bursaria</i>. Equally
interesting, again, are the <i>vibracula</i>, long thread-like structures,
attached by short footstalks. These keep up a constant whip-like
motion, the object of which is not quite clear. The ovicells, or
egg receptacles, are found at the lower ends of the zo&aelig;cia in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>
form of shields, helmets, or vesicles. In <a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>., Nos. 95 and 96,
a front and edge view of the statoblast is shown highly magnified.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>1. <i>Notamia bursaria</i>, shepherd’s-purse Bryozoa; 2. Polyp magnified and withdrawn
into its cell; 3. Portion of a colony of Hydroid polyps.</p></div>

<p>Another sub-order consists of the Cyclostomata, or round-mouthed
Bryozoans, of which the Tubulipora is the typical form. The
stocks are cup-shaped incrustations, the individuals radiating outwards,
as in <a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>., No. 92. <i>Tubularia dumortierii</i> is a very
interesting form, the germinal bodies, statoblasts, being formed as
cell masses on the strand, or funiculus, which also maintains
the stomach in its place. They are round or oval in shape, and
brown or yellow in colour, and consist of two valves fitted one upon
the other like watch glasses, as shown in No. 96. A number of other
statoblasts are shown, Nos. 97, 98, and 99. The edge running round
No. 95 is seen to have barbed tips; the ring itself contains small air
chambers, and is termed the swimming belt. It is, in fact, a perfect
hydrostatic apparatus, giving support to the winter buds or statoblasts
on the surface of the water. The barbed hooks apparently act
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
as anchors, and by their means they catch on at points suitable
for their development during the coming spring. As soon as the
time comes, the two halves split apart and the germinal mass
emerges forth. Out of these winter buds and statoblasts asexually
produced individuals arise, which reproduce themselves sexually,
their descendants again yielding winter germs. In short, an alternation
of generations is a continually recurring process.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_362" src="images/fig_362.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 362.&mdash;<i>Lingula pyramidata.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Brachiopoda.</i>&mdash;Here again we have to do with an enigmatical class
of arm-footed animals, of which the Lamp-shells may be regarded
as typical. These have remained
unaltered from the earliest geological
epochs. Brachiopods are
divided into two orders: those
having shells without hinges, and
those with shells hinged together.
On the whole they possess less
interest for the microscopists than
many other animals, except in their
earliest developmental stages of
existence.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting of
the hinge-class group, living chiefly
near the shores of the warmer seas,
is the Lingulid&aelig;. The valves are
almost exactly similar, but are not
hinged together, and have no processes
for the support of the thick
fleshy spiral arms of the animals.
In <i>L. pyramidata</i>, found around the Philippine Islands (<a href="#fig_362">Fig. 362</a>),
the stalk is nine times longer than the body. The animal does not
attach itself by this, but moves about like a worm, making tubes
out of sand, into which it can withdraw itself and disappear. The
cilia at the mantle edge form a fine sieve, thus preventing foreign
particles from entering the gills. Its internal structure possesses
points of interest, and the parasitic growths covering the cartilaginous
structure, miscalled a shell, are curious, and excite the
attention of the naturalist.</p>

<p>Another bivalve so unlike a crustacean, among which it has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span>
placed, I may venture to describe among Lamp-shells. I refer to the
barnacle (Lepas) generally met with covering the bottoms of ships.
These, as in the former genus, are more interesting to the microscopist
in the early stage of existence, and also for the curious parasites
known to infest them. The barnacle protrudes through its two
valves six pairs of slender, bristly, two-branched filamentous limbs,
which keep up a constant sweeping motion, and whereby it secures
its supply of food (<a href="#fig_363">Fig. 363</a>). When first hatched the young are in
the Nauplius stage, being furnished with a median eye and three
pairs of flagellated appendages. After
enjoying a free life the larva moults and
passes into a second stage, in which with
its two eyes and compressed carapace
(shown in <a href="#fig_364">Fig. 364</a>) it so nearly resembles
a Daphnia. Before these thoracic appendages
entirely disappear they first change
places, and then each is seen to be provided
with a sucker; by this means the
larva fixes itself to its permanent resting-place,
while a cement gland pours out a
secretion that glues it firmly to the point
of attachment chosen. These Cirripedes
are not true parasites, inasmuch as they
do not extract nourishment from the body
to which they are attached.</p>

<p>One species, the Proteolepas, is in the
adult stage a maggot-like, limbless, shell-less animal found living
within the mantle chamber of other members of the same order,
while the root-headed Cirripedes (<i>Peltogaster curvatus</i>, as <a href="#fig_364">Fig. 364</a>,
No. 1) live parasitically upon higher crustaceans.</p>

<p><i>Echinodermata.</i>&mdash;This sub-kingdom includes the star-fishes, stone-lilies,
sea-urchins, feather-stars, and sea-cucumbers, some of which
have been already alluded to, and are so well known that they need
no lengthy description, while of the fossil sea-urchins of our chalk
formations, the Pentremites and Crinoids, whose silicious remains
are so abundant and so familiar to naturalists and geologists, but
little remains to be said. They are chiefly interesting to the
microscopist from their calcareous and silicious appendages, known
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>
as spicula. In the sea-urchin, brittle-star, or feather-star, the outer
body surface consists almost wholly of a deposit of calcium carbonate,
combined in the form of little plates built up into a rigid “test,”
whereas in the star-fish it usually forms a kind of scaffolding,
between the layers of which there stretches a firm leathery skin.
Among the sea-cucumbers, the living specimens of which present
extraordinary variations both in form and character, the deposit
consists chiefly of small spicules which grate when the skin is cut
with a knife. If a thin section of
the skin is examined under the
microscope, the spicules are seen to
be profusely distributed in the
middle layer. The same deposit
takes place in the stalked column
of a crinoid and in sea-urchins
(Echinodermata), which has tended
to preserve them in the fossilised
state. <a href="#fig_365">Fig. 365</a> is selected as exhibiting
to perfection the Medusa-headed
Pentacrinoid. This echinoderm
differs in two characters: first, its
microscopic structure is that of a
meshwork deposited in the spaces of
a network of soft tissue; secondly,
that each element, whether a spicule
or a plate, is, despite its trellised
structure, deposited around regular
lines of crystallisation (shown in
<a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>., Nos. 89 and 90). Owing to these characteristics the
minutest portion of an echinoderm skeleton is readily recognised, even
when fossilised, under the microscope. Even the species of the sea-cucumber
can be determined by the shape of their spicules.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_364" src="images/fig_364.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 364.&mdash;Parasitic Barnacles.</p>

<p>1. <i>Peltogaster curvatus</i>; 2. Nauplius
larva of Parthenopea; &times;
200.</p></div>

<p>Another noticeable feature in the radiate structure is that in many
cases it gives to the animal a star-shape, to which the names of star-fish
and brittle-star are given (see <a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>., No. 91, and <a href="#pl_xvii">Plate XVII</a>.,
<i>f</i> and <i>n</i>). The ordinary five-rayed star-fish is found everywhere
around the English coasts. This constant arrangement of organs holds
good in the majority of the echinoderms; it can be detected in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span>
Holothurians, where, beside the feathery tentacles of the head, rows
of shorter sucker-like processes will be found, which in some instances
extend the whole length of the body, the fixed number of rows
being also five in their internal organs. Hence these animals were
formerly grouped under Radiata. But if a sea-cucumber or sea-urchin
be dissected, a marked distinction will be found between
them, in one portion of the organism in particular: the intestine
is shut off from the rest of the body-cavity, often coiling round
inside. Examine a star-fish or sea-urchin on the under-surface
of the rays, and, passing in five bands from top to bottom, a
number of small cylindrical processes are seen gently waving about;
these lie in two rows with a clear space between them, and are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>
termed in consequence <i>ambulacrum</i>. They end in sucker-like discs,
which enable the animal to attach itself, or pull itself against strong
currents.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><i>a.</i> Crown and part of stem; <i>b.</i> Upper surface of body, the arms broken
away, showing the food grooves passing to the central mouth.&mdash;(Warne.)</p></div>

<p>Just one other special feature should be noticed: radial canals
pass along under the ambulacra, and join a ring-canal around the
mouth, well supplied by nerve cells.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><i>Crinoids</i> (stone-lilies), on the other hand, are formed of a series of
flat rings, pierced through by a narrow canal. The ossicles, as they are
termed, are joined by ligaments passing through their solid substance
and endowed with muscular power; the central part serves for the
passage of blood-vessels, and is surrounded by a sheath of nervous
tissue that controls the movements of the stem, the latter being
encrusted by a number of fine rootlets. The stems possess a
limited power of bending. In the words of Professor Agassiz, “The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span>
stem itself passes slowly from a rigid vertical attitude to a curved
or even a drooping position; the cirri move more rapidly than the
arms, and the animal uses them as hooks to catch hold of objects,
and on account of their sharp extremities they are well adapted
to retain their hold of prey.” The rosy-feather star-fish is often
found clinging to a tube of the Sabella worm; the food of crinoids
consists of foraminifera, diatoms, and the larv&aelig; of crustaceans.
There are so many curious features in connection with the Echinodermata
that my readers may with advantage consult “The
<i>Challenger</i> Reports” and Warne’s “Natural History” on other
points of interest.</p>

<p><i>Holothuroidea</i> (sea-cucumbers) are elongated slug-like creatures,
the skin being in structure similar to that of the slug, with a
comparatively small amount of calcareous matter. Usually this
occurs in small spicules, which assume very definite shapes, as the
anchors of Synapta (<a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>., No. 87, and in <a href="#fig_355">Fig. 355</a>).
There are also rings of calcareous plates around the gullet, five
of which have the same relation to the radial water-vessels as the
auricles round the jaws of a sea-urchin, and which likewise serve for
the attachment of muscles. These plates are seen in <a href="#pl_viii">Plate VIII</a>.,
Nos. 171 and 172, as they appear coloured by selenite films under
polarised light. Around the mouth in Cucumaria is a fringe of
branched tentacles connected with the water-vascular ring; these
appear to be used as a net to intercept floating organisms.</p>

<p>Correlated with the star-fishes is a small family based on the
character of their pincer-like organs, called pedicellari&aelig;, on the
surface of the test (shown in <a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>., Nos. 93 and 94, magnified
&times; 25). Movable spines cover the surface of these echinoderms, varying
in size from minute bristle-like structures to long rods. The
pedicellari&aelig; are, it is believed, derived from the smaller spines, and
two of them are united at the base by muscles, slightly curved, and
made to approach each other at their extremities. There is a gradual
modification of this type through the whole series. Many uses have
been assigned to them, as the holding of food, as they have been seen
to hold to the fronds of seaweed and keep them steady until the spines
and tube feet can be brought into action. The inner surface of the
pedicellari&aelig; are known to be the most sensitive, and the blades close
on the minutest object touching the inner surface. Beside these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span>
peculiar bodies the surface of the skin has small tubular processes,
and tubular feet with suckers at the end. At the extremity of each
arm is a single tube-foot with an impaired tentacle, and above this
again is a small eye coloured by red pigment.</p>

<p>Passing by many other points of interest in the Echinoid&aelig;, the
spines are seen to be attached to the test or shell by a ball and
socket joint and well-arranged muscles, whereby the spines can
be moved in any direction. The tubercles, however, do not cover
the whole test, but are disposed chiefly in five broad zones extending
from one pole to another. When a transverse section of a
spine is examined by a medium power it is seen to be made up of a
series of concentric and radiating layers (shown in <a href="#pl_xviii">Plate XVIII</a>., Nos.
1 and 2), the centre being occupied by reticulated structure and
structureless spots arranged at equal distances; these may be termed
ribs or pillars. Passing towards the margin are other rows conveying
the impression of a beautiful indented reticulated tissue. Many of
the spines present no structure, while others exhibit a series of
concentric rings of successive growth, which strongly remind one of
the medullary rays of plants. When a vertical section of a spine
is submitted to examination, it is seen to be composed of cones
placed one above the other, the outer margin of each cone being
formed by the series of pillars. In certain species of Echinus the
number of cones is very considerable, while in others there are seldom
more than one or two to be found; from these, transverse sections
may when made show no concentric rings, only the external row of
pillars.</p>

<p>The skeleton of echinoderms contains but a small amount of organic
matter, as will be seen on dissolving out the calcareous portion in
dilute nitric or hydrochloric acids. The residuum structure will
appear to be meshes or areol&aelig;, bounded by a substance having a
fibrous appearance, intermingled with granulous matter; in fact, it
bears a close resemblance to the areolar tissue of higher animals, and
the test may be considered as formed, not by the consolidation of
the cells of the ectoderm, as in the mollusc, but by the calcification
of the fibro-areolar tissue of the endoderm. This calcification of a
simple fibrous tissue by the deposit of a mineral substance, not in
the meshes of areol&aelig; but in intimate union with the organic basis,
is a condition of much interest to the physiologist; it presents an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>
example of a process which seems to have an important share in the
formation and growth of bone, namely, in the progressive calcification
of the fibrous tissue of the periosteum membrane covering of the
bone.</p>

<p>The development of the sea-urchin from the fertilised egg first
divides and then sub-divides, and in a short time the embryo issues
forth with a small tuft of cilia, by means of which it swims off
freely. The larv&aelig;, in its full development, measures about one millimetre
in diameter, and is a curious and remarkable creature.</p>

<p><b>The sub-kingdom Mollusca</b> comprises some fifty thousand
species, and fresh forms are being constantly discovered, the number of
the aquatic genera being more than double that of the terrestrial
species, for it matters not to what depth of ocean the dredge is let
down, some new form is certain to be gathered. The <i>Challenger</i>
expedition has enriched our knowledge of the deep-sea fauna to an
enormous extent; so much so, that fifty volumes have already been
published descriptive of animals brought to the surface. Nevertheless,
we are told that the great coast lines of South America, Africa,
Asia, and parts of Australia have been but imperfectly explored for
smaller kinds of Mollusca.</p>

<p>Molluscs are soft-bodied, cold-blooded animals, without any internal
skeleton, but this is compensated for by the external hardened shell,
which at once serves the purpose of bones, and is a means of defence.
These bodies are not divided into segments like those of worms and
insects, but are enveloped in a muscular covering or skin, termed
the mantle, the special function of which in most species is the
formation and secretion of the shell. The foot, which serves the
double purpose of locomotion and burrowing in the sand or rock, is
an organ particularly characteristic of most molluscs. There are
many departures from this rule, as, for instance, in the group
Chitonid&aelig;, where the shell takes the form of a series of eight adjacent
plates; and in another, the Pholadid&aelig;, there are one or more accessory
pieces in addition to the two principal valves. Some are bivalved,
others univalved, and concealed beneath the skin. All shells are
mainly composed of carbonate of lime, with a small admixture of
animal matter. Their microscopic examination reveals a great diversity
of structure, as we shall presently see, and they are accordingly
termed porcellaneous, nacreous, glassy, horny, and fibrous. Most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span>
molluscs have the power of repairing injuries to their shells; many
exhibit an outer coat of animal matter, termed the <i>peristracum</i>,
the special function of which is to preserve the shell from atmospheric
and chemical action of the carbonic acid in the water in
which they dwell.</p>

<p>The shells of gastropods are enlarged with the growth of the mollusc
by the addition of fresh layers to the margin. In some species
the periodic formation of spines occurs; a typical case will be found
among Muricid&aelig;. The varied colours of shells are due to glands
situated on the margin of the mantle, and beneath the peristracum;
occasionally the inner layer of porcellaneous shells is of a different
colour to the outer, as, for example, in the helmet-shells (Cassis),
much used by carvers of shell cameos. Light and warmth, as in the
vegetable kingdom, are the great factors in the production of brilliant
colours. In cold climates land snails bury themselves in winter
time in the ground or beneath decaying vegetable matter, and in
hot seasons they close up the aperture of the shells with a temporary
lid, called an <i>epiphragm</i>. These exhibit great tenacity of
life, as, for instance, in the Egyptian desert-snail, <i>Helix desertorum</i>.
The reproductive system is in all cases effected by means of eggs.
The ova are usually enclosed in capsules, and deposited in masses,
and the number of eggs contained in the squid and the whelk have
been stated to be thirty or forty thousand. The ova of molluscs
may be gradually developed into the adult, or there may be a free-swimming
ciliated larval stage, or a special larval form, as in the
fresh-water mussel. Most are provided with a more or less distinct
head; both cephalopods and gastropods are furnished with eyes.
In land snails these are found placed on projecting stalks. In
most cases the utility of molluscs far outweighs the injury occasioned
by a few species, as, for instance, the Teredo, and the burrowing
habits of the Pholas and Saxicava, compact marble having been found
bored through by them.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Robertson wrote me in 1866:&mdash;“Having, while residing
here (Brighton), opportunities of studying the <i>Pholas dactylus</i>,
I have endeavoured during the last six months to discover how
this mollusc makes its hole or crypt in the chalk&mdash;by a chemical
solvent? by absorption? by ciliary currents? or by rotatory motions?
My observations, dissections, and experiments set at rest controversy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span>
on this point. Between twenty and thirty of these creatures
have been at work in lumps of chalk in sea water in a finger
glass and a pan, at my window for the last three months. The
<i>Pholas dactylus</i> makes its hole by grating the chalk with its rasp-like
valves, licking it up when pulverised with its foot, forcing
it up through its principal or branchial siphon, and squirting it
out in oblong nodules. The crypt protects the Pholas from Conferve&aelig;,
often found growing parasitically not only outside the shell
but even within the lips of the valves, thus preventing the action of the
siphons. In the foot there is a spring, or style, which when removed
is found to possess great elasticity, and this seems to be the
mainspring of the motion of the Pholas.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_367" src="images/fig_367.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 367.&mdash;Hexabranchus.</p></div>

<p>I must pass by many groups and orders to more aberrant types,
represented by the naked-gilled orders, Opisthobranchiata and
Nudibranchiata. These gastropods constitute a large sub-order
of extremely beautiful molluscs, remarkable in shape, and often
brilliant in colour. The distinguishing character of these typical
forms consists in the peculiar nature and situation of their breathing
organs, which are exposed on the back of the animal or around
the anterior part, and are not protected by the mantle. But the
situation is varied, and the gills are sometimes placed on each side of
the body, respiration being effected by the ciliated surface of the whole.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span>
For these and other reasons they have been placed in four groups.
Nudibranchs are found in all parts of the world, and are most
abundant in depths where the choicest seaweeds and corallines
abound. Their fecundity is very great, as many as sixty thousand
eggs being deposited by a single female at one time. They are
eaten as a luxury where they most abound.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_368" src="images/fig_368.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 368.&mdash;Longitudinal section of <i>Pleurobranchus aurantiacus</i>, showing
circulation and gills or branchi&aelig;.&mdash;(Warne.)</p></div>

<p>In the Opisthobranchs the branched veins as well as the auricle
are placed behind the ventricle of the heart. They differ from
Nudibranchs inasmuch as they are usually furnished with a pair
of tentacles and labial palpi, or an expansion of the skin like the
veil of the larval form. To clearly understand the character of the
internal organisation of these curious animals, the longitudinal section
given in <a href="#fig_368">Fig. 368</a> must be consulted: <i>p</i> is the foot; <i>a</i> the mouth,
covered above with the veil-like expansion, over which are the tentacles,
<i>c</i>; the branchial veins, <i>v</i>, carry the blood to the gills, from which it
flows into the heart at <i>h</i>. This disposition is the opposite of that
which characterises the Prosobranchus. Another anatomical peculiarity,
which may here be referred to, is the direct communication
of the system of blood vessels with the surrounding medium;
a characteristic common to most other molluscs, and on which
depends the changeable external appearance of the animal. In the
illustration of Pleurobranchus here given, <i>g</i> indicates the opening
of the duct which conveys water direct to the blood, and through
which the blood vessels permeate the back and foot. Like the holes
in the sponges, it can be filled or emptied at the will of the animal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span></p>

<p>Although this, in the main, is the principle of the circulation in most
of this order, one branch possesses no special breathing organs,
respiration being carried on throughout the naked skin of the body.</p>

<p>With regard to the Nudibranchiata, the group having the most
symmetrical form is the extensive family Doridid&aelig;, characterised by
differences in the branchi&aelig;, the relative proportion of the mantle
to the foot, and variations in the radula and jaws. The general
aspect of the genus Doris, although drawn on a small scale, is represented
in <a href="#pl_xvii">Plate XVII</a>., Fig. <i>b</i>. The whole sub-order of Nudibranchs
has become more generally known and admired since the publication
of Alder and Hancock’s monograph with its many attractive coloured
illustrations.</p>

<p>These gastropods can be kept alive for some time in a small
aquarium if the precaution is observed of often
changing the water and adding a little fresh
seaweed. Numerous curious microscopic forms
of life may be found adhering to them.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_369" src="images/fig_369.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 369.&mdash;<i>Aplysia
dipilans.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Tunicata.</i>&mdash;The most remarkable group of
animals belonging to this sub-order are the Ascidians.
They derive their name from the test
or tunic, a membranous consistence, in which
they dwell, and which often includes calcareous
spicules. The test has two orifices, within which is the mantle.
Few microscopic spectacles are more interesting than the circulation
along this network of muslin-like fabric, and that of the ciliary
movement by which the fluid is kept moving. In the transparent
species, as Clavelina and Perophora, the ciliary movement is seen to
greater advantage. The animals are found adhering to the broad
fronds of fuci near low water-mark. They thrive in tanks, and
multiply both by fission and budding. Two species are figured in
<a href="#pl_xvii">Plate XVII</a>., Figs. <i>i</i> and <i>k</i>, the zooids of which were found arranged
in clusters, as represented.</p>

<p><i>Aplysiid&aelig;</i> (sea-hares), so called on account of a slight resemblance
to a crouching hare. The body form is elongated with a partially
developed neck and head, oral and dorsal tentacles, and furnished
beneath the mantle with a shelly plate to protect the branchi&aelig;.
The mouth is provided with horny jaws, and the gizzard is armed
with spines, to prepare the food for digestion. The side lobes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">550</span>
are thin and large, and are either folded over the back or used in
swimming. <a href="#fig_369">Fig. 369</a> is a reduced drawing of <i>A. dipilans.</i></p>

<p>The Pectinibranchs are known as violet sea-snails, Ianthinid&aelig; and
Scalariid&aelig;. The radula consists of numerous rows of pointed teeth
arranged in cross series, forming an angle in the middle. There
is no central or rachidian tooth, and they have thin trochiform
shells adapted for a pelagic life. They are mostly of a violet colour,
from which they derive their name, the colour being more vivid
on the underside, which is turned up towards the light when the
animal is swimming near the surface of the sea (<a href="#fig_370">Fig. 370</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

end of the float; <i>c.</i> Shell; <i>l.</i> Float; <i>p.</i> Foot; <i>t.</i> Head.</p></div>

<p>The most interesting feature in connection with these oceanic snails
is the curious float which they construct to support their egg-capsules.
It is a gelatinous raft, in fact, enclosing air-bubbles, which is attached
to the foot, the egg capsules being suspended from its under-surface.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span>
They are unable to sink so long as they are in connection with their
floats, and are therefore often cast on shore during storms, and furnish
an endless series of microscopic specimens. The violet snails feed on
various kinds of jelly-fish, and occur in shoals.</p>

<p><i>Pond Snails.</i>&mdash;The three families, Limnœid&aelig;, Physid&aelig;, and
Chilinid&aelig;, form a special group of the pulminate, sessile-eyed fresh-water
snails. The larger family of these belongs to the genus
Limnœa, having a compressed and triangular head with two
tentacles and eyes placed at their inner base. They are prolific
and gregarious, and their ova are enclosed in transparent gelatinous
capsules, deposited in continuous series, and firmly glued to submerged
stems and leaves of aquatic plants. <i>L. stagnalis</i> is common
in all ponds, marshes and slow-running rivers of Great Britain.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_371" src="images/fig_371.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 371.&mdash;Ova and young of <i>Limn&aelig;us stagnalis</i>.</p></div>

<p>One of the species, <i>L. trancatula</i>, is the host of the liver-fluke so
fatal to sheep. The fluke parasite passes one stage of its existence
in the intestine of the pond snail.</p>

<p>Each ova-sac of Limnœa contains from fifty to sixty ova (represented
in <a href="#fig_371">Fig. 371</a>, at <i>a</i>). If examined with a low power soon after
the eggs are deposited, they appear to consist simply of a pellucid
protoplasmic substance. In about twenty-four hours a very minute
yellowish spot, the nucleus, is discovered near the cell-wall. In
another twenty-four hours the nucleus referred to is seen to have
assumed a somewhat deeper colour and to contain within it a minute
spot&mdash;a nucleolus.</p>

<p>On the fourth day the nucleus has changed its position, and is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span>
enlarged to double the size; a slightly magnified view is seen at <i>b</i>.
On a closer examination a tranverse fissure is seen; this on the
eighth day divides the small mass as at <i>c</i>, and the outer wall is
thickened. The embryo becomes detached from the side of the cell,
and moves with a rotatory motion around the interior; the direction
of this motion is from the right to the left, and is always increased
when sunlight falls upon it. The increase is gradual up to the
eighteenth day, when the changes are more distinctly visible, and
the ova crowd down to the mouth of the ova-sac, as at <i>d</i>. By
employing a higher magnifying power a minute black spec, the
future eye (<i>e</i>) and tentacles of the snail, is quite visible. Upon
closely observing it, a fringe of cilia is noticed in
motion near the edge of the shell. It is now
apparent that the rotatory motion first observed
must have been in a great measure due to this;
and the current kept up in the fluid contents of
the cell by the ciliary fringes. For days after
the young animal has escaped from the egg, this
ciliary motion is carried on, not alone by the fringe
surrounding the mouth, but by cilia entirely surrounding
the tentacles themselves, which whips
up a supply of nourishment, and at the same
time aeration of the blood is effected. From the
twenty-sixth to the twenty-eighth day it appears
actively engaged near the side of the egg, using
force to break through the cell-wall, which at
length it succeeds in accomplishing; leaving its shell in the ova-sac,
and immediately attaching itself to the side of the glass its ciliary
action recommences, and it appears to have advanced a stage, as at <i>f</i>.
It is still some months before the embryo grows to the perfect form,
<a href="#fig_372">Fig. 372</a>; the animal is here shown with its sucker-like foot adhering
closely to the glass of the aquarium. A single snail will deposit
from two to three of these ova-sacs a week, producing, in the course
of six weeks or two months, from 900 to 1,000 young.</p>

<p>The shell itself is deposited in minute cells, which take up a
circular position around the axis; on its under-surface a hyaline
membrane is secreted. The integument expands, and at various
points an internal colouring-matter or pigment is deposited. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span>
increase of the animal goes on until the expanded foot is formed,
the outer edge of which is rounded off and turned over by condensed
tissue in the form of a twisted wire; this encloses a network
of small vessels filled with a fluid in constant and rapid motion.
The course of the blood or fluid, as it passes from the heart, may
be traced through the larger branches to the respiratory organs,
consisting of branchial-fringes placed near the mouth; the blood
may also be seen returning through other vessels. The heart, a
strong muscular apparatus, is pear-shaped, and enclosed within a
pericardium or extremely thin and pellucid enveloping membrane.
The heart is seen to be furnished with muscular bands of considerable
strength, the action of which appears like the alternate to-and-fro
motion occasioned by drawing out a band of indiarubber, and which,
although so minute, are clearly analogous to the muscular fibres of
the mammal heart; it beats or contracts at the rate of about sixty
times a minute, and is placed rather far back in the body, towards
the axis of the shell. The nervous system is made up of ganglia, or
nervous centres, and distributed throughout the various portions of
the body.</p>

<p>The singular arrangement of the eye cannot be omitted; it
appears at an early stage of life to be within the tentacle, and consequently
capable of being retracted into it. In the adult animal
the eye is situated at the base of the tentacle; and although it can
be protruded at pleasure for a short distance, it seems to depend
much upon the tentacle for protection as a coverlid&mdash;it invariably
draws down the tentacle over the eye when that organ needs protection.
The eye itself is pyriform, somewhat resembling the round
figure of the human eye-ball, with its optic-nerve attached. In colour
it is very dark, having a central pupillary-opening for the admission
of light. The tentacle, which is cylindrical in the young animal,
becomes flat and triangular in shape in the adult. The tentacles
serve in some respect to distinguish species. In Limnœa they are,
as I have said, compressed and triangular, with the eyes at their inner
base. In Physa they are cylindrical and slender and without lateral
mantle lobes. The development of the lingual membrane is delayed;
consequently, the young animal does not early take to a vegetable
sustenance: in place of teeth it has two rows of cilia, as before stated,
which drop off when the teeth are fully formed. The lingual band
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span>
bearing the teeth, or the “tongue,” as it is termed, consists of
several rows of cutting spines, pointed with silica.</p>

<p>It is a fact of some interest, physiologically, to know that if the
young animal is kept in fresh water alone, without vegetable matter
of any kind, it retains its cilia, and arrest of development follows, and
it more slowly acquires gastric teeth, and attains to perfection in form
or size. If, at the same time, it is confined within a narrow cell or
space, it grows only to such a size as will enable it to move about
freely; thus it is made to adapt itself to the necessities of a restricted
state of existence. Some young animals in a narrow glass-cell, at
the end of six months, were alive and well; the cilia were seen to
be retained around the tentacles in constant activity, whilst other
animals of the same brood and age, placed in a situation favourable
to growth, attained their full size, and produced young, which grew
in three weeks to the size of their elder relations.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>My experimental investigations were further extended to the
development of the lingual membrane, or teeth, of Gastropoda,
as well as the jaw and radula. In Limnœa, the teeth when fully
developed resemble those of Helix; that is to say, in the fully grown
animal are found several rows or bands of similar teeth, with simple
obtuse cusps and a much suppressed central tooth. In the young
snail a high power of the microscope is required to make them out.
The dental band, however, in most Mollusca is disposed in longitudinal
series, but varies a good deal in this respect, as will be
seen on reference to my several papers, with illustrations of upwards
of a hundred different species, published in “Linn&aelig;an Transactions” of
1866, and in the “Microscopical Society’s Transactions” of 1868. By
way of example I may say, in the Pulmonata the lingual band usually
consists of a single median row, the laterals on each side being broad
and similar. But in many other groups the teeth are arranged in
three, five, or seven dissimilar series. Taking Nerita as a type, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span>
broad teeth on each side of the median are termed <i>laterals</i>; and the
numerous small teeth on the outside of the band, known as the
<i>pleur&aelig;</i>, are termed <i>uncini</i>.</p>

<p>Since the investigations of Lov&eacute;n into the lingual dentition of
the Mollusca, various observers have studied the subject, with great
advantage to our knowledge of the affinities of these animals. That
these investigations have proved of value is shown by the light
which has been shed on the true position of many species. When
once we have ascertained the homology of a genus, whose relations
were otherwise somewhat doubtful, it is surprising how other characteristics,
even of the shell, probably misunderstood before, concur to bear
out the affinities indicated by the lingual band. These tooth-bearing
membranes, armed with sharp cutting points, admirably adapted
for the division of the food on which they feed, are most of them
beautiful objects for the microscope.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_373" src="images/fig_373.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 373.</p>

<p>1. Palate of <i>Buccinum undatum</i>, common Whelk, seen under polarised light;
2. Palate of <i>Doris tuberculata</i>, Sea-slug.</p></div>

<p>The two ends of each longitudinal row of teeth are connected
with muscles attached to the upper and lower surfaces of cartilaginous
cushions; the alternate contractions and extensions of the muscles
cause the bands of teeth to work backwards and forwards, after the
fashion of a chain-saw, or rather of a rasp, upon any substance
to which it is applied, and the resulting wear and tear of the anterior
teeth are made good by a development of new teeth in the secreting
sac in which the hinder end of the band is lodged. Besides the
chain-saw-like motion of the band the lingual membrane has a kind
of licking or scraping action as a whole. With the constant growth
of the band new teeth are developed, when the teeth on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">556</span>
extreme portion of the band differ much in size and form from
those in the median line.</p>

<p>As I have shown in the papers already referred to, that as each
row is a repetition of the first, the arrangement of teeth admits
of easy representation by a numerical formula, in which, when the
uncini are very numerous, they are indicated by the sign ∞ (infinity),
and the others by the proper figure. Thus, ∞ · 5 · 1 · 5 · ∞,
which, in the genus Trochus, signifies that each row consists of one
median, flanked on both sides by five lateral teeth, and these again
by a large number of uncini. When only three areas are found,
the outer ones must be considered the pleur&aelig;, inasmuch as there
is frequently a manifest division in the membrane between them and
the lateral areas.</p>

<p>Most of the Cephalopod molluscs are provided with well-developed
teeth, and they are, as we know, carnivorous. The teeth of the cuttle-fish,
<i>Sepia officinalis</i> (<a href="#pl_v">Plate V</a>., No. 111), resemble those of the Pteropoda,
and have the same formula, 3 · 1 · 3. Sepia are also furnished
with a retractile proboscis, and a prehensile spiny collar, apparently
for the purpose of seizing and holding prey while the teeth are
tearing it to pieces. In the squid Loligo (<a href="#pl_v">Plate V</a>., No. 113) the
median teeth are broad at the base, approach the tricuspid form
with a prolonged acute central cusp, while the uncini are much
prolonged and slightly curved. The lingual band increases in
breadth towards the base, sometimes to twice that of the anterior
portion. This band, mounted dry, forms an attractive object for
black-ground illumination.</p>

<p>In another family, that of the rock-limpet, <i>Patella radiata</i>, the
lingual band (<a href="#pl_v">Plate V</a>., No. 116) well serves to distinguish it from
the better-known common limpet. It is furnished with a remarkable
long ribbon, studded by numerous rows of strong dark-brown
tricuspid teeth. The lingual membrane when not in use lies folded
up in the abdominal cavity. The teeth of Acm&aelig;a are somewhat
differently arranged (<a href="#pl_v">Plate V</a>., No. 117); their formula is 3 · 1 · 3.</p>

<p><i>Testacella maugei</i>, belonging to Pulmonifera, is slug-like in appearance,
and subterranean in its habits, chiefly feeding on earth-worms.
During winter and in dry weather it forms a kind of cocoon, and thus
completely encloses itself in an opaque white mantle; in this way
it protects itself from frost and cold. Its lingual membrane
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">557</span>
is large, and covered with about fifty rows of divergent teeth,
gradually diminishing in size towards the median row; each tooth
is barbed and pointed, broader towards the base, and with an
articulating nipple set in the basement membrane. A few rows are
represented slightly magnified (<a href="#pl_v">Plate V</a>., No. 121). Their formula
is 0 0 · 1 · 0 0.</p>

<p>The boat-shell, <i>Cymba olla</i>, belonging to the Velutinid&aelig;, formula
0 · 1 · 0, or 1 · 1 · 1. The lingual band (<a href="#pl_v">Plate V</a>., No. 118) is
narrow and ribbon-like in its appearance, with numerous trident-shaped
teeth set on a strong muscular membrane. The end of the
band and its connection with the muscles at the extremity of
the cartilaginous cushion is shown in the drawing. The blueish
appearance is produced by a selenite film and polarised light. In
<i>Scapander ligniarius</i> the band (<a href="#pl_v">Plate V</a>., No. 119) is also narrow,
but the teeth are bold and of extraordinary size; their formula
is 1 · 0 · 1. This mollusc is said to be eyeless. <i>Pleurobranchus
plumula</i> belongs to the same family; its teeth are simple, recurved,
and convex, and arranged in numerous divergent rows, the medians
of which are largest. The mandible (<a href="#pl_v">Plate V</a>., No. 122) presents
an exceedingly pretty tesselated appearance, and the numerous
divergent rows of teeth are tricuspid.</p>

<p>The velvety-shell, <i>Velutina l&aelig;vigata</i>, formula 3 · 1 · 3. The
teeth (<a href="#pl_v">Plate V</a>., No. 108) are small and fine; medians recurved,
with a series of delicate denticulations on either side of the central
cusp, which is much prolonged: 1st laterals, denticulate, with outer
cusp prolonged; 2nd and 3rd laterals, simple curved or hooked-shaped.
The mandible (No. 109), divided in the centre, forms two
plates of divergent denticulations.</p>

<p>The ear-shell, <i>Haliotis tuberculatus</i>, is a well-known beautiful
shell, much used for ornamental purposes. The lingual band
(<a href="#pl_v">Plate V</a>., No. 114), is well developed. The medians are flattened-out,
recurved obtuse teeth; 1st laterals, trapezoidal or beam-like;
uncini numerous, about sixty, denticulate, the few first pairs
prolonged into strong pointed cusps.</p>

<p>The top-shell, <i>Turbo marmoratus</i>. After the outer layer of shell is
removed, it presents a delicate pearly appearance. Its lingual band
(No. 123) closely resembles Trochus; it is long and narrow, the
median teeth are broadest, with five recurved laterals, and numerous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">558</span>
rows of uncini, slender and hooked. A single row only is represented
in the plate.</p>

<p><i>Cyclotus translucidus</i>, a family of operculate land-shells, belongs
to the Cyclostomatid&aelig;. The teeth shown in No. 110, formula
3 · 1 · 3, are arranged in slightly divergent rows on a narrow band;
they are more or less subquadrate, recurved, with their central
cusps prolonged. <i>Cistula catenata</i>, one of the family Cyclophorid&aelig;;
its band (No. 115) formula, 2 · 1 · 2. Its teeth resemble those
of Littorina. The lingual band of Cyclostomatid&aelig; points out
a near alliance to the Trochid&aelig;; but this question can only be
determined by an examination of several species, when it may,
perhaps, be decided to give them rank as a sub-order. They
are numerous enough; the West Indian islands alone furnish 200
species.</p>

<p>The length of the lingual band, and number of rows of teeth
borne on it, vary greatly in different species. But it is among
the Pulmonifera we meet with the most astonishing instances
of large numbers of teeth. <i>Limax maximus</i> possesses 26,800,
distributed through 180 rows of 160 each, the individual teeth
measuring only one 10,000th of an inch. <i>Helix pomatia</i> has
21,000, and its comparatively dwarfed congener, <i>H. absoluta</i>, no
less than 15,000.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Shell of Mollusca.</i>&mdash;In my opening sketch of the
sub-order Mollusca an idea may have been gathered of the general
character of the shell covering of these animals. The simplest form
of shell occurs in the rudimentary oval plate of the common slug,
<i>Limax rufus</i>. It is embedded in the shield situated at the back,
near the head of the animal. In the Chitons, a small but singular
group of molluscs allied to the univalve limpets, we have an ovoid
shell, made up of eight segments, or movable plates, which give them
a resemblance to enormous woodlice. These have been regarded as
forming a transition series&mdash;a link between one division and the
other. The shell in by far the greater portion of all the molluscs is
developed from cells that in process of growth have become hardened
by the deposition of calcareous matter in the interior. This earthy
matter consists principally of calcium carbonate deposited in a
crystalline state; and in certain shells, as in that of the oyster
(<a href="#pl_xviii">Plate XVIII</a>., <a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a>), from the animal cell not having sufficiently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">559</span>
controlled the mode of deposition of the earth particles, they have
assumed the form of perfect rhomboidal crystals.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption">PLATE XVIII.</p>
<img id="pl_xviii" src="images/pl_xviii.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="caption">SECTIONS OF SHELL-STRUCTURE.</p></div>

<p>The shell of the wing-shells, <i>Pinna ingens</i> (<a href="#pl_xviii">Plate XVIII</a>., No. 7),
is composed of hexagonal cells, filled with partially translucent calcareous
matter, the outer layer of which can be split up into prism-like
columns. Figs. 3 and 6 are horizontal sections of the <i>Haliotis
splendens</i>, with stellate pigment in a portion of the section, and wavy
lines, as in the dentine of the human tooth, and of <i>Terebratulata
rubicuna</i>, showing radiating perforations. Nos. 4 and 5, sections of
the shell of a crab, show pigment granules beneath the articular
layer and the general hexagonal structure of the next layer.</p>

<p>Some difference of opinion has been expressed with regard to the
formation of pearls, but it is now generally understood to be a
diseased condition. Pearls are matured on a nucleus, consisting of
the same matter as that from which the new layers of shell proceed
at the edge of the mussel or oyster. The finest kinds are formed in
the body of the animal, or originate in the pearly-looking part of the
shell. It is from the size, roundness, and brilliancy of pearls that
their value is estimated.</p>

<p>The microscope discloses a difference in the structure of pearls:
those having a prismatic cellular structure have a brown horny
nucleus, surrounded by small imperfectly-formed prismatic cells;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">560</span>
there is also a ring of horny matter, followed by other prisms, and
so on, as represented in <a href="#fig_374">Fig. 374</a>; and all transverse sections of
pearls from oysters show the same successive rings of growth or
deposit.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Fig. 374.</p>

2. A transverse section of another Pearl, showing its central cellular structure,
with outside rings of true pearly matter. (Magnified 50 diameters.)</p></div>

<p>In a segment of a transverse section of a small purple pearl from
a species of Mytilus (<a href="#fig_375">Fig. 375</a>), all trace of prismatic structure has
disappeared, and only a series of fine curved or radiating lines is
seen. This pearl consists of a beautiful purple-coloured series of
regular lamin&aelig;, many of which have a series of concentric zones,
and are of a yellow tint. The most beautiful sections for microscopic
examination are obtained from Scotch pearls.</p>

<p><i>Preparation of the Teeth and Shell of Mollusca for Microscopical
Examination.</i>&mdash;The method of preparing lingual membranes of Mollusca
is as follows: Under a dissecting microscope, and with a
large bull’s eye lens, cut open and expose to view the floor of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">561</span>
mouth; pin back the cut edges throughout its length, and work out
the dental band with knife and forceps. The band being detached,
place it in a watch-glass, and boil in caustic potash solution for
a few minutes. Having by this process freed the tongue from its
integuments, remove it, wash it well, and place it for a short time in
a dilute acid solution, either acetic or hydrochloric. Wash it well
and float it upon a slide; with a fine sable brush open it out flat,
and remove whatever dirt or fibre may be adhering to it. Lastly,
place it in weak spirit and water, and there let it remain for a few
days before mounting in formalin. Canada balsam renders them
rather too pellucid, and the finer teeth are thereby lost.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_375" src="images/fig_375.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 375.</p>

<p>1. Transverse section of a small Pearl from a Mytilus; 2. Horizontal section
magnified 240 diameters to show prismatic structure and transverse stri&aelig;.</p></div>

<p>The preparation of shell structure must be proceeded with with
some amount of care and caution, or the delicate reticulated network
membrane will be destroyed. If any acid solvent be used to
remove the calcareous structure it should be much diluted, so that
the action may proceed slowly rather than hastily. In the young
hermit-crab, for example, where the calcareous and membranous
portions of the shell are continuous, and the calcium carbonate in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">562</span>
a relatively small proportion, a strong acid solution would entirely
destroy the specimen. In the case of nacreous shells the process of
cutting and grinding must also be proceeded with with some amount
of caution. The operation should be examined as the process proceeds,
and under polarised light. Sections of shell structure are
usually mounted in Canada balsam. Under the heading <i>Technique</i>
much useful information on this and kindred subjects will be found
in the “Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society.”</p>

<h3>Annulosa, Worms, and Entozoa.</h3>

<p>The Annulosa of Huxley embraces the lowest grade of articulated
animals, most of which are now grouped with Metazoa, while some
writers place them in a sub-kingdom Vermes. It appears to me
then only possible to describe this heterogeneous group of worm-like
animals among those which resemble each other in certain
negative features, but not possessing any of the distinctive characters
of those previously described. There are numerous species among
Entozoa, every one of which is of the highest interest to mankind
in general, and to animal life as a whole. To these I shall devote
some attention, from the wide-spread importance attached to them.
They are characterised by having a soft absorbent body with little
or no colour, in consequence of being excluded from light, living
within the bodies of animals and absorbing their vital juices, thereby
inflicting a large amount of injury and death upon the whole vertebrate
kingdom. They bear in this respect a close analogy to parasitic
Fungi in the nature of their destructive action upon plant life,
which I have fully discussed in a previous chapter.</p>

<p>The relations which obtain between parasites and their hosts are
in all respects conditioned by their natural history; and without
a detailed knowledge of the organisation, the development, and the
mode of life of the different species, it is impossible to determine
the nature and extent of the pathological conditions to which they
give rise, and at the same time find means of protection against
guests in every way so unwelcome.</p>

<p>The nutritive system of the entozoa must be regarded as in the
lowest state of development, yet there are some among them of
a higher grade, as will be seen as we proceed. All are remarkable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">563</span>
alike for their vast productiveness and for their peculiar metamorphoses.
For example, the greater number of the T&aelig;nia begin
their lives as sexless, encysted larv&aelig;, and on entering their final
abode, segments are successively added, until the worm has finally
reached the adult stage. Again, the tapeworm of the cat has its
origin in the encysted larv&aelig; found in the livers of the mouse and
rat. Another species of entozoa inhabit the stomach of the stickle-back,
and only attain their perfect form in the stomachs of aquatic
birds that feed exclusively on fish. Another infests the mantle of
pond-snails, and through their agency, the embryos pass into the
stomach of sheep.</p>

<p>An almost endless number of similar transformations take place
in other genera. The simplest form among internal parasites is
the Gregarin&aelig;, formerly grouped among Protozoa. They consist
of a simple limiting membrane, with a mass of granular matter
enclosed and surrounding a nucleus (<a href="#pl_iii">Plate III</a>., No. 53). These
parasites pass through a crystoid stage in the body of one of the
lower animals, usually the earthworm, <i>Lumbricus agricola</i>. In the
more mature organism an envelope, differentiated from the protoplasm
within, can be made out (No. 54); this affords an
indication of greater differentiation in the subjacent layer of protoplasm.
An anterior portion is in many cases separated by a
constriction from the cylindrical or band-like body (No. 56).
Gregarin&aelig; multiply when encysted, and divide into a multitude
of minute <i>pseudo-navicula</i>, so named from their resemblance in
shape to a well-known form of Diatomace&aelig;. When a young pseudo-navicule
escapes it behaves somewhat like an amœba, and if
perchance it is swallowed by an appropriate host, it develops at
once into the higher stage. The various forms are represented in
<a href="#pl_iii">Plate III</a>., Nos. 53&mdash;61. Miescher, in 1843, described suchlike
bodies, taken from the muscles of a mouse. A good account of
specimens obtained from the muscles of a pig was published by the
late Mr. Rainey in the “Philosophical Transactions,” 1857. He
regarded them as cestoid entozoa. They have been described under
a variety of names, as worm-nodules, egg-sacs, eggs of the fluke,
young measles, &amp;c. M. Lieberk&uuml;hn carefully traced the pseudo-navicul&aelig;
after leaving the perivisceral cavity of the earth-worm;
he found large numbers of small corpuscles, exhibiting amœba-like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">564</span>
movements, as well as pseudo-navicul&aelig;, containing granules, formed
in an encysted Gregarin&aelig;. He imagines that these latter bodies
burst, and that their contained granules develop into the amœbiform
bodies which subsequently become Gregarin&aelig;.</p>

<p>Professor Ray Lankester made a careful examination of more
than a hundred worms for the purpose of studying these questions,
but he succeeded in arriving at no other conclusion than that
certain forms may be the by-products of encysted Gregarin&aelig;. The
<i>G. lumbricus</i> is one of those forms which are unilocular. The
vesicle is not always very distinct, and is sometimes altogether
absent; occasionally it contains no granules, sometimes several, one
of which is generally nucleated. In other of these cysts a number
of nucleated cells may be seen developing from the enclosed
Gregarina, which gradually become fused together and broken up,
until the entire mass is converted into nucleated bodies, often seen
in different stages of development, assuming the form of a double
cone, as that presented by certain species of Diatomace&aelig;. At length
the cyst contains nothing but pseudo-navicul&aelig;, sometimes enclosing
granules; these gradually disappear, and finally the cyst bursts.
Encystation seems to take place much more rarely among the
bilocular forms of Gregarin&aelig; than in the unilocular species found
in the earthworm and other Annelids.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>Dr. J. Leidy published in the “Transactions of the Philadelphia
Society,” 1853, the results of his examinations of several new species
of Gregarin&aelig;. He described a double membrane “within the parietal
tunic of the posterior sac, this being transparent, colourless, and
marked by a most beautiful set of exceedingly regular parallel longitudinal
lines.”</p>

<p>Professor R. Leuckart is the latest writer on the parasites of
animals, and to him we are indebted for a more systematic account of
the whole group, and their life-history, than to any previous investigator.
I can only attempt to give a mere outline of the developmental
stages of a few typical forms of parasites, commencing
with the cystic tapeworm, T&aelig;nia. These worms are ribbon-like in
appearance, and are divided throughout the greater part of their
length into segments, and their usual habitation is the intestinal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">565</span>
cavity of vertebrate animals. The anterior extremity of a t&aelig;noid
worm is usually called the head, and bears the organ by which
the animal attaches itself to the mucous membrane of the
creature which it infests. These organs are either suckers, or
hooks, or both conjoined. In T&aelig;nia, four suckers are combined with
a circlet of hooks, disposed around a median terminal prominence.
The embryo passes through certain stages of development&mdash;viz.,
four forms or changes: but the embryo itself is very peculiar, consisting
of an oval non-ciliated mass, provided with six hooks, three
upon each side of the middle line. T&aelig;nia are found enclosed in
various situations besides that of the alimentary canal: the eye, the
brain, the muscular tissues, the liver, &amp;c., of animals. The following
cystic worms are usually included in this genera, <i>Cysticercus Anthocephalus</i>,
<i>Cœnurus</i>, and <i>T. Echinococcus</i>. <a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>., No. 100, shows
an adult specimen of the latter with rostellum suckers, and three
successive segments, the last of which is the ova sac. The water-vascular
system is represented coloured by carmine. This parasite
infests the human body as frequently as many other species. My
accurately-drawn figure is copied from Cobbold’s “Introduction to
the Study of Entozoa.”</p>

<p><i>Cysticercus fasciolaris</i> is developed within the liver of white mice;
<i>Cysticercus cellulos&aelig;</i> in the muscles of the pig; hence we have the
diseased state of pork familiarly known as “<i>measly pork</i>.” Should
a lamb become infested with T&aelig;nia the final transformation will
be different; within a fortnight symptoms of a disease known as
“staggers” manifest themselves, and in the course of a few weeks the
<i>Cœnurus cerebralis</i> will be developed within the brain. Von Siebold
pointed out the bearing of this fact upon the important practical
problem of the prevention of “staggers.” Others belonging to the
same class of parasites are quite as remarkable in their preference for
the alimentary canal of fishes. The Echinorhynchus is developed in
the intestinal canal of the flounder, <i>Tri&aelig;nophorus nodulus</i> in the
liver of the salmon. Thus, by careful and repeated observation with
the microscope, a close connection is found to exist between the
cystic and cestoid entozoa.</p>

<p>The Echinococcus (<a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>., No. 101) infests the human liver.
These parasites are always found in cysts, and in closed cavities in
the interior of the body. They are united in fours by a very short
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">566</span>
stalk or pedicle, common to the whole. By an increase of magnification
the contents of a cyst present the several structures represented
in <a href="#fig_376">Fig. 376</a>.</p>

<p>Echinorhynchus, or spiny-headed threadworms, constitute a group
of entozoa which undergo a metamorphosis hardly, perhaps, less
remarkable than that known to take place in other Nematode worms.
Leuckart instituted, in 1861, a series of experiments with the ova of
<i>Echinorhynchus proteus</i> found parasitic upon the <i>Gammarus pulex</i>.
The ova of <i>E. proteus</i> resemble in form and structure those of allied
species. They are of a fusiform shape, surrounded with two membranes,
an <i>external</i> of a more albuminous nature, and an <i>internal</i>
chitinous one. When the eggs reach the intestine the outer of
these membranes is absent, being in fact digested, while the inner
remains intact until ruptured by the embryo.</p>

<p>The typical Threadworm belonging to the order Nematoidea infest
the intestines of children, and are a source of much suffering. The
egg is elliptical, and contains a mass of granular protoplasm, the
external wall of which soon becomes marked out into a layer of cells.
The mouth of the worm appears as a depression at the end of the
blunt head. When the muscular system and alimentary canal are
developed the embryo hatches out, some few of which are free living
forms; most of them lead a parasitic life. Their reproduction is
enormous, representing thousands of eggs and embryos.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">567</span></p>

<p>Of the non-parasitic species of thread-worm, the common vinegar
eel, Anguillula,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> affords an example. This is found in polluted
water, bog-moss, and moist earth, as well as in vinegar; also in the
alimentary canal of the pond-snail, the frog, fish, &amp;c. Another
species is met with in the ears of wheat affected with a blight termed
the “cockle”; another, the <i>A. glutinis</i>, in sour paste. If grains of
the affected wheat are soaked in water for an hour or two before they
are cut open, the so called “eels” will be found. The paste-eel
makes its appearance spontaneously just as the pasty mass is
turning sour; the means of securing a supply for microscopical
examination consists in allowing a portion of the paste in which they
show themselves to dry up, and laying it by for stock; if at any time
a portion of this is introduced into a little fresh-made paste, and the
whole kept warm and moist for a few hours, it will be found to
swarm with these wriggling little worms. A small portion of paste
spread over the face of a Coddington lens is a ready way of viewing
them.</p>

<p><i>Trichina spiralis.</i>&mdash;One of the smallest and most dangerous of all
human internal parasites is <i>T. spiralis</i>, since it finds its way into the
muscles throughout the human body. The young animal presents
the form of a spirally-coiled worm in the interior of a minute oval-shaped
cyst (<a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>., No. 104), a mere speck scarcely visible to
the naked eye. In the muscular structure it resembles a small
millet seed, somewhat calcareous in composition. The history of
the development of Trichina in the human muscle is briefly that in
a few hours after the ingestion of infected pork, Trichina, disengaged
from the muscle, will be found in the stomach: hence they pass
into the small intestine, where they are further developed. Continuing
their migrations, they penetrate far into the interior of
the primitive muscular fasciculi, where they will be found, in about
three days after ingestion, in considerable numbers, and so far developed
that the young entozoa have almost attained a size equal to
that of the full-grown Trichina (<a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>., No. 105). They quickly
advance into the interior of the muscular fasciculi, where they live
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">568</span>
and multiply in continuous series, while the surrounding structures
as well as the muscular tissue undergo a process of histolysis. The
destructive nature of the parasite is very great.</p>

<p>The number of progeny produced by one female may amount to
several thousands, and as soon as they leave the egg they either
penetrate through the blood-vessels, or are carried on by the circulation,
and ultimately become lodged in the muscles situated in the
most distant parts of the body. Here, as already explained, they
become encysted.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

membrane under different aspects; blood-corpuscles, some crenated and others
with stained discs (&times; 1,200).&mdash;(Crookshank.)</p></div>

<p>Professor Virchow draws the following conclusions:&mdash;“1. The
ingestion of pig’s flesh, fresh or badly dressed, containing Trichin&aelig;,
is attended with the greatest danger, and may prove the proximate
cause of death. 2. The Trichin&aelig; maintain their living properties in
decomposed flesh; they resist immersion in water for weeks together,
and when encysted may, without injury to their vitality, be plunged
in a sufficiently dilute solution of chromic acid for at least ten days.
3. On the contrary, they perish and are deprived of all noxious
influence in ham which has been well smoked, kept a sufficient length
of time, and then well boiled before it is consumed.”</p>

<p>A more minute Filarian worm has been detected in the human
blood-vessels, known as <i>Filaria sanguinis hominis</i>. This worm
carries on its work of destruction throughout the night; during the
day it remains perfectly passive. It increases rapidly, and produces
swellings of the glandular structures of the body, somewhat after
the nature of those characteristic of the Bombay plague, with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">569</span>
slight difference, that after death the swellings are seen to be due to
the vast accumulations of the <i>Filaria sanguinis</i> blocking the blood-vessels.
The accompanying <a href="#fig_377">Fig. 377</a> shows a similar infiltration of
monads in the blood of rats dying of plague in Bombay.</p>

<p><i>Trematode Worms.</i>&mdash;In the order Trematoda, to which the fluke
belongs, the body is unsegmented, and to the naked eye smooth
throughout, with a blood circulatory system, and two suctorial discs
at the hinder end. There is a distinct digestive canal, usually forked,
furnished with only one aperture, the mouth. The excretory organs
open out as in tape worms, and the male and female organs co-exist
in the same individual.</p>

<p>The Fluke (shown in <a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>., No. 103) is cone-shaped, and is the
<i>Amphistome conicum</i> of Rudolphi. This parasite is common in oxen,
sheep, and deer, and it has also been found in the Dorcas antelope.
It invariably takes up its abode in the first stomach, or rumen,
attaching itself to the papillated folds of the mucous membrane. In
the full-grown, adult stage, it rarely exceeds half an inch in length. It
is certainly one of the most remarkable in form and organisation of
any of the internal parasites.</p>

<p>The larger fluke (<i>Fasciola hepatica</i>) often attains to an inch or
more in size. It is not only of frequent occurrence in all varieties
of grazing cattle, but has likewise been found in the horse, the ass,
and also in the hare and rabbit and other animals. Its occurrence
in man has been recorded by more than one observer. The oral
sucker forming the mouth leads to a short œsophagus, which very
soon divides into two primary stomachal or intestinal trunks, the
latter in their turn sending off branches; the whole together forming
that attractive dendritic system of vessels so often compared to
plant-venation. This remarkably-formed digestive apparatus is
represented in <a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>., Nos. 106 and 107, <i>Fasciola gigantea</i> of
Cobbold, and should be contrasted with the somewhat similarly racemose
character of the water-vascular system. Let it be expressly
noted, however, that in the digestive system the majority of the
tubes branch out in a direction obliquely downwards, whereas those
of the vascular system slope obliquely upwards. A further comparison
of the disposition of these two systems of structure, with the
same systems figured and described as characteristic of the Amphistoma,
will at once serve to demonstrate the important differences
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">570</span>
which subsist between the several members of the two genera, if we
turn to the consideration of the habits of <i>Fasciola hepatica</i>, which,
in so far as they relate to excitation of the liver disease in sheep,
acquire the highest practical importance. Intelligent cattle-breeders,
agriculturists, and veterinarians have all along observed that the
<i>rot</i>, as this disease is commonly called, is particularly prevalent after
long-continued wet weather, and more especially so if there have
been a succession of wet seasons; and from this circumstance they
have very naturally inferred that the humidity of the atmosphere,
coupled with a moist condition of the soil, forms the sole cause of
the malady. Co-ordinating with these facts, it has likewise been
noticed that the flocks grazing in low pastures and marshy districts
are much more liable to the invasion of this endemic disease than
are those pasturing on higher and drier grounds; a noteworthy
exception occurring in the case of those flocks feeding in the salt-water
marshes on our eastern shores. <a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>., No. 106, <i>Fasciola
gigantea</i>: the anterior surface is exposed to display oral and ventral
suckers, and the dendriform digestive apparatus injected with ultra-marine;
No. 107 shows the dorsal aspect of the specimen and the
multiramose character of the water-vascular system, the vessels
being injected with vermilion.</p>

<p>In their larval condition the Amphistoma live in or upon the body
of the pond-snail. This we infer from the circumstance that the
larv&aelig;, or cercari&aelig;, of a closely-allied species, the <i>Amphistoma subclavatum</i>,
are known to infest the alimentary canal of frogs and newts, and
have also been found on the body of the Planorbis by myself. The
cercari&aelig; larv&aelig; are taken, it is believed, by the sheep and the cattle
while drinking. The earliest embryotic stage in which I have found the
embryo fluke is represented at <a href="#fig_378">Fig. 378</a>, No. 1. In the year 1854, whilst
observing the habits of Limnœa and other water-snails, I brought
home specimens from the ornamental water in the Botanic Gardens;
upon these were discovered thousands of minute thread-like worms,
subsequently met with on other embryos, and at first taken to be
simple infusorial animals, but upon placing them in a glass vessel
these minute bodies were observed to detach themselves and commence
a free-swimming existence. A fringe of cilia was seen to
surround the flask-shaped body (No. 1).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_378" src="images/fig_378.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 378.&mdash;Forms of Cercaria; stages in the development of the Fluke.</p>

8. tail portion half an hour after division; 9. parasitic worm of another species

<p>The study of these embryos throws a flood of light upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">571</span>
obscure history of Cercari&aelig;. After a short period of wandering, their
embryos fasten upon the water-snail, and compel it to act as a
wet-nurse, and prepare it for a further and higher stage of life. The
earliest condition in which I have discovered them concealed about
the body of the water-snail is shown at No. 2; in appearance,
a simple elongated sac filled with ova or germs, and which in a short
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">572</span>
time develop into the caudate worms already spoken of; their
tails gradually attaining to the length of the mature embryos,
Nos. 3 and 4, the latter being a full-grown <i>Cercaria ephemera</i>.</p>

<p>Diesing described no less than twelve species of Cercari&aelig;, some
of the most curious of which live on the puddle-snail, in colonies of
thousands. All throw off their tails at the moment of changing into
a fluke. On placing some <i>Cercaria furcata</i> (Nos. 6 and 7) under the
microscope, they were seen to plunge about in frantic attempts to
escape from confinement. Suddenly I saw them shed their tails and
their bodies divide into two parts, each half swimming about as
vigorously as before, quite indifferent as to the severance, and
apparently dying from exhaustion. Those represented in Nos. 6
and 7 have a highly-organised nervous system, forming a continuous
circuit throughout the body and tail. The mouth is furnished with
a sucker and hooklets, which can be projected out some distance,
while a digestive apparatus and ventral opening or sucker can be
differentiated. The tail is bifurcated and articulated with the body
by a sort of ball-and-socket joint, and when broken off, the convexity
of one part is seen to accurately fit into the concavity of the other;
it lashes about this appendage with considerable dexterity, rarely
attaching itself to any of the small aquatic plants.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>There is yet another Filarian worm, a pest to the poultry-yard,
the Gape-worm, <i>Sclerostoma syngamus</i>. This parasite is widely
distributed, and is invested with special interest, since it produces
disease, and kills annually thousands of young chickens, pheasants,
partridges, and many of the larger kinds of wild birds. The worms
find their way into the windpipe or trache&aelig;, through the drinking
water, while in the embryotic or cercarian stage of existence, and their
increase is so rapid, the birds quickly die of suffocation. The female
gape-worm often attains to a considerable size, and when full grown
resembles the well-known mud-worm of the Thames (<i>Gordius aquaticus</i>).
She measures full six-eighths of an inch in length, while the
male only measures one-eighth. So insignificantly small is he that
the female carries him about tucked into a side pocket. The ova
sac occupies a considerable portion of the internal body space, and
is always found loaded with eggs in all stages of development, numbering
some five hundred or a thousand. In shape these are ovoid.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">573</span>
On cutting open the windpipe of chicken and partridges, I have
found their trache&aelig; literally swarming with the gape-worm.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>A remarkable form of the Trematode worm is <i>Bilharzia h&aelig;matobra</i>
of Cobbold, <i>Distomia h&aelig;matobium</i> of other authors (<a href="#pl_iv">Plate IV</a>.,
No. 102). This genus of fluke, discovered by Dr. Bilharz in the
human portal system of blood vessels, gives rise to a very serious
state of disease among the Egyptians. So common is the occurrence
of this worm, that this physician expressed his belief that half the
grown-up population of Egypt suffer from it. Griesinger conjectures
that the young of the parasite exist in the waters of the Nile, and in
the fish which abound. Dr. Cobbold thinks “it more probable
that the larv&aelig;, in the form of cercari&aelig;, redi&aelig;, and sporocysts, will
be found in certain gasteropod mollusca proper to the locality.”
The anatomy of this fluke is fully described by K&uuml;chenmeister in
his book on parasites, by Leuckart,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> and by Cobbold. The eggs
and embryos of Bilharzia are peculiar in possessing the power of
altering their forms in both stages of life; and it is more than
probable that the embryo form has been mistaken for some extraordinary
form of ciliated infusorial animal, its movements being
quick and lively. We cannot fail to notice the curious form of the
male animal, and, unlike the Filarian previously described, it is he
who carries the female about and feeds her. The whip-like appendage
seen in the figure is a portion of the body of the female.
The disease produced by this parasite is said to be more virulent
in the summer months, probably owing to the greater abundance of
cercarian larv&aelig; at this period of the year.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_379" src="images/fig_379.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 379.&mdash;The double parasitic worm (<i>Diplozoum paradoxum</i>).</p></div>

<p>There are also double parasitic worms, which may be described as
a sub-order of Trematoda, differing very much from those previously
described. These live on the gills of several species of fresh-water
fish, the gudgeon and minnow, for instance. Among them is a most
remarkable creature well deserving the name of <i>Diplozoum paradoxum</i>
which has been bestowed upon it. It consists of two complete
mature similar halves, each possessing every attribute of a perfect
animal (<i>a</i>). Each of the pointed front ends has a mouth aperture,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">574</span>
and close to it two small sucking discs; while each individual has
a separate intestine, consisting of a medium tube and innumerable
side-branches. At the hinder end of the body are two suckers sunk
in a depression, and protected by four hard buckle-shaped organs.
The eggs are elongated, and provided at one end with a fine thread-like
appendage (<i>b</i>). In this egg the young (<i>c</i>)&mdash;which at the time of
hatching is only about one-hundredth of an inch&mdash;takes about a
fortnight to develop. It is covered with cilia, has two eyes and two
suckers; after quitting the egg, the larv&aelig; are very lively and restless in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">575</span>
their movements, gliding about and then swimming off with rapidity.
If unable to find the fish into which they are destined to live,
they grow feeble and perish, but if successful they grow into the
Diporpa (<i>d</i>), which is flattened and lancet-shaped, and bears a small
sucking disc on the under surface and a conical excrescence on
the back. After living in this state for some weeks, and gaining
nourishment by sucking the blood from the fish’s gills, the worms
begin to join together in pairs, one specimen seizing the conical
excrescence of another by its ventrical sucker; then, by a truly
acrobatic feat, the second twists itself to the dorsal excrescence of the
first, and in this state an inseparable fusion takes place between the
suckers and the excrescences involved in the adhesion.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>In the group Vermes, the more highly-organised Annelida must
be included. These, for the most part, live either in fresh or salt
water. The Annelids are various, while the Planaria, a genus of
Turbellaria, are very common in pools, and resemble minute leeches;
their motion is continuous and gliding, and they are always found
crawling over the surfaces of aquatic plants and animals, both in
fresh and salt water. The body has the flattened sole-like shape
of the <i>Trematode entozoa</i> (<a href="#fig_378">Fig. 378</a>, No. 9), the mouth is surrounded
by a circular sucker; this is applied to the surface of the plant from
which the animal draws its nourishment; it is also furnished with
a rather long proboscis, which is probably employed for a similar
purpose.</p>

<p>Planari&aelig; multiply by eggs, and by spontaneous fissuration in
a transverse direction, each segment becoming a perfect animal.
Professor Agassiz believes that the infusorial animals, Param&aelig;cium
and Kolpoda, are simply planarian larv&aelig;.</p>

<p>Hirudinid&aelig;, the leech tribe, are usually believed to form a link
between the Annelida on the one hand, and the Trematoda on the
other; their affinities place them closer with the latter than the
former. Although deprived of the characteristic set&aelig; of the Annelida,
and exhibiting no sectional divisions, they are provided with a sucker-like
mouth possessed by Trematoda, but they present no resemblance
to them in their reproductive organs. On the other hand, in the
arrangement of the nervous system and in their vascular system, the
Hirudinid&aelig; resemble Annelida. The head in most of the Annelida
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">576</span>
is distinctly marked, and furnished with eyes, tentacles, mouth, and
teeth, and in some instances with auditory vesicles, containing
otolithes. The nervous system consists of a series of ganglia
running along the ventral portion of the animal, and communicating
with a central mass of brain.</p>

<p><i>Hirudina medicinalis</i> puts forth a claim for special attention
on the ground of services rendered to mankind. The whole
of the family live by sucking the blood of other animals; and for
this purpose the mouth of the leech is furnished with a number
of strong horny teeth, by which they cut through the skin. In the
common leech three rows of teeth exist, arranged in a triangular,
or rather triradiate form, a structure that accounts for the peculiar
appearance of leech bites. The most interesting
part of the anatomy of the leech to
microscopists is certainly the structure of the
mouth (<a href="#fig_380">Fig. 380</a>). This is a muscular dilatable
orifice, within which three beautiful little
semi-circular saws are situated, arranged so
that their edges meet in the centre. It is by
means of these saws that the leech makes the
incisions whence blood is to be procured, an
operation which is performed in the following
manner. No sooner is the sucker firmly fixed
to the skin, than the mouth becomes slightly
everted, and the edges of the saws are thus made to press upon the
tense skin, a sawing movement being at the same time given to each,
whereby it is made gradually to pierce the surface, and cut its way
to the capillary blood-vessels beneath.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_380" src="images/fig_380.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 380.&mdash;Mouth of
Leech.</p></div>

<p>In Clepsinid&aelig; the body is of a leech-like form, but very much
narrowed in front, and the mouth is furnished with a prehensile
proboscis. These animals live in fresh water, where they may often
be seen creeping over aquatic plants. Their prey is the pond-snail.</p>

<p><i>Tubicola.</i>&mdash;The worms belonging to this series of branchiferous
Annelida are all marine, and distinguished by their invariable habit
of forming a tube or case, within which the soft parts of the animal
can be entirely retracted. This tube is usually attached to stones
or other submarine bodies. Externally it is composed of various
foreign materials, sand, crystalline bodies, and the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of shells;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">577</span>
internally it is lined with a smooth coating of sarcode, sometimes
of a harder consistency. The Tubicola generally live in societies,
winding their tubes into a mass which often attains a considerable
size; only a few are solitary in their habits. They retain their position
in their cases by means of tufts of bristles and spines; the
latter, in the tubicular Annelids, are usually hooked, so that by
applying them to the walls of the case, the animal is enabled to
oppose a considerable resistance to any effort made to withdraw it. In
the best known family of the order (Sabellia), the branchi&aelig; are
placed in the head, and form a circle
of plumes, or a tuft of branched organs.
The Serpulid&aelig; form irregularly twisted
calcareous tubes, and often grow together
in large masses, when they
secure themselves to shells and similar
objects; other species, Terebellid&aelig;,
which build their cases of sand and
stones, appear to prefer a life of solitude.
The best known form is <i>Terebella
littoralis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> The curious little spiral
shells seen upon the fronds of seaweeds
are formed by an animal
belonging to the Spirorbis.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_381" src="images/fig_381.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="hang">Fig. 381.&mdash;Serpula with extended
tentacles and body protruding
from calcareous case.</p></div>

<p>If the animals be placed in a vessel
of sea-water a very pleasing spectacle
will soon be witnessed. The top part
of the tube is seen to open, and the creature cautiously protrudes
a fringe of tentacles; these gradually spread out two beautiful fan-like
rows of tentacles, surrounded by cilia of a rich purple or red
colour. These serve the double purpose of breathing and feeding
organs. When withdrawn from its calcareous case, the soft body is
seen to be constructed of a series of rings, with a terminal prehensile
foot by which it attaches itself.</p>

<p>Many Annelids are without tubes or cells of any kind, simply
burying their bodies in the sand near tidal mark. The Arenicola,
lob-worm, is a well-known specimen of the class; its body is so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">578</span>
transparent that the circulating fluids can be distinctly seen under
a moderate magnifying power. Two kinds of fluids flow through
the vessels, one nearly colourless, the other red; the vessels through
which the latter circulate are described as blood-vessels.</p>

<p>Not very much interest attaches to the developmental stage of
the Annelida. They issue forth from ova, and the embryo so closely
resemble ciliated polypes, that competent observers have mistaken
them for animals belonging to a lower class; a few hours’ careful
watching is sufficient to dispel a belief of the kind, when the
embryonic, globular, or shapeless mass is seen to assume a form of
segmentation, and soon the various internal organs become more
and more developed, eye spots appear, and the young animal arrives
at the adult stage of its existence.</p>

<h3>Crustacea.</h3>

<p>The crustaceans comprise a large assemblage of Arthropods, presenting
great diversity of structure. Some of the parasitic species
have become so simplified in organisation that they appear to
present no relationship with the higher members of the class, yet
it is certain that all the species, whether terrestrial or aquatic,
belong to the same stock, and may have had origin in the same
fundamental plan of structure. Essentially, the body consists of a
large number of segments, to each of which is attached a pair
of two-branched appendages; the external branch is termed the
exopodite and the internal the endopodite. Five segments at the
front end of the body unite to form a head, the appendages of
the first two being situated in front of the mouth, and performing
the office of feelers or antenn&aelig;, while those of the remaining
three segments are transformed into jaws, the first pair of jaws
being the mandibles and the following two pairs the maxill&aelig;.
The rest of the appendages are variously modified and to some
are attached respiratory organs in the form of gills. Crustaceans
are broadly divided from Centipedes, Millipedes, Insects, &amp;c., by the
presence of two pairs instead of one pair of antenn&aelig;, and by the
possession of branchial and not tubular (tracheal) respiratory
organs. Arachnida and some other species are again widely
separated. The majority of the young on leaving the egg are quite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">579</span>
unlike the parent, and only acquires their definite form after undergoing
a series of changes. The earliest stage, which has been called
the Nauplius, already referred to in connection with the barnacle, is
a minute body showing no trace of segmentation, and provided with
a single eye, and three pairs of swimming appendages, which become
the two pairs of antenn&aelig; and the mandibles of the adult. This stage
is by no means of invariable occurrence, but is chiefly characteristic
of the lowest members, the Entomostraca, and is rare in the higher,
Malacostraca. The typical crustaceans
are shrimps, crayfish, &amp;c., so familiarly
described by Huxley. The zo&aelig;a stage
of the crab, a minute transparent
creature, which undergoes several
changes, swims about flapping its
long jointed abdomen, like some of the
Entomostraca, and the shrimp in particular.
The larva of crayfish, the so-called
glass-crab, is very peculiar and
interesting. The sessile-eyed series, in
which the compound eyes are never
mounted on a movable stalk, and to
which the Isopoda belong, exhibits great
diversity of structure as well as of habits
and habitat. Some live in fresh water,
most are marine, while others live on land and take to a parasitic
life.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 382.&mdash;Male Gnathia,
enlarged.</p></div>

<p>This genus contains Gnathia, in which the male and female are so dissimilar,
that they are frequently referred to as members of two families.
In the adult male the mandibles are powerful and prominent, and the
head is large, squared, and as wide as the thorax. In the female, on
the contrary, the head is curiously small and triangular, without
visible mandibles, and the thorax is much dilated. The creatures
are about one-sixth of an inch long, and of a greyish colour, and the
destruction they bring about is due to their habit of boring into
timber below water mark. <a href="#fig_382">Fig. 382</a> represents an enlarged view
of the male Gnathia. These crustaceans are vegetarians, and feed
on wood. Other members of the group, known as fish lice, are
much larger in size, and chiefly infest the cetacea, and bear in

addition two large eyes. By means of their powerful fore feet the
Cymothord&aelig; attach themselves to both marine and fresh-water fish,
showing a preference for the inside of the mouth of their host.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 383.&mdash;1. Cypris; 2.
Cyclops; 3. <i>Branchipus
grubei</i>.</p></div>

<p>The bar-footed group Copepoda are free living, and the thorax
bears four or five swimming feet; the abdomen is without appendages.
The best known fresh-water form is Cyclops, the structure of
which serves as a type of the order. The body is, as is well known
to microscopists, broad in front and tapering
behind, being thus, when viewed
swimming, pear-shaped in outline. The
dorsal elements of the head are fused to
form a carapace, which bears a single eye,
from which circumstance it derives its
name. The eggs are carried by the
female in a couple of ova-sacs attached
to the last segment of the thorax, and so
prolific are these creatures that a female
will produce over four thousand million
young. The young when hatched is an
oval Nauplius, which after two or three
moults acquires the adult state. In the
family of the Apodid&aelig; we have an equally
well-known crustacean, the Branchipus.
In the Branchipodid&aelig; the body is also
elongated, but there are no appendages to
the abdomen, which consists of nine segments,
while there are eleven pairs of thoracic appendages. The
head shield is not developed backwards, and the large separated
eyes are supported on distinct stalks. In the male the second
antenn&aelig; are converted into claspers. These crustaceans swim upside
down (<a href="#fig_383">Fig. 383</a>).</p>

<p><b>Cladocera</b> (<i>Daphniad&aelig;</i> of Dr. Baird).&mdash;The water-flea (<i>Daphnia
pulex</i>) may be taken as the best known example of the order.
The body of this little active animal is narrowed in front, and at the
posterior end, where the carapace is deeply notched, is the tip of the
abdomen bearing the pair of rigid barbed set&aelig; from which the genus
takes its name. At the front of the head is a large compound eye
and two pairs of branched plumed appendages, antenn&aelig;. The first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">581</span>
pair of these are small and simple. The jaws consist of the mandibles
and the first pair of maxill&aelig;, the second pair of maxill&aelig; being obsolete
in the adult. The thorax comprises five segments, each bearing a
pair of leaf-like swimming limbs. The abdomen consists of three
segments, and is destitute of limbs. The males are usually smaller
than the females, and much rarer, being rarely met with before
the end of summer.</p>

<p>Eggs are laid both in summer and winter, and are passed into
a brood-pouch, separating the upper surface of the thorax from the
backward extension of the carapace. Here the summer eggs hatch,
but the winter set are enclosed in a kind of capsule developed from
the carapace. This capsule, termed the <i>ephippium</i>, is cast off with
the next moult of the mother’s integument (a process necessary for the
gradual growth of the crustacean), and falling to the bottom of the
water, gives exit to the embryos, which hatch in its interior, and
the young born from these “ephippial” eggs produce young, which in
their turn become mothers. It appears, then, the winter eggs are
enclosed in capsules of more than usual hardness to enable them to
withstand any degree of cold that might otherwise prove fatal to the
parent. Dr. Baird found, on examining ponds that had been again
filled up by rain after remaining two months dry, numerous specimens
of Daphnia and <i>Cyclops quadricornis</i> in all stages of growth.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>We learn also from his investigations that the Daphnia have many
enemies. “The larva of the <i>Corethra plumicornis</i>, known to microscopical
observers as the skeleton larva, is exceedingly rapacious of
Daphnia. Pritchard says they are the choice food of a species of Nais;
and Dr. Parnell states that the Lochleven trout owes its superior
sweetness and richness of flavour to its food, which consists of small
shell-fish and Entomostraca.” These crustaceans abound in fresh
and salt water. Artemi&aelig; are formed exclusively in salt water, in
salt marshes, and in water highly charged with salt. Myriads of
these Entomostraca are found in the salterns at Lymington, in the
open tanks or reservoirs where the brine is deposited previous to
boiling. A pint of the fluid contains about a quarter of a pound of
salt, and this concentrated solution destroys most other marine
animals. During the fine days in summer Artemi&aelig; may be observed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">582</span>
in immense numbers near the surface of the water, and, as they are
frequently of a lively red colour, the water appears tinged with the
same hue. The movements of this little animal are peculiar. It
swims about on its back, and by means of its tail, its feet being at
the same time in constant motion. They are both oviparous and
ovoviviparous, according to the season of the year. At certain
periods they only lay eggs, while during the hot summer months
they produce their young alive. In about fifteen days the eggs are
expelled in numbers varying from 50 to 150. As is the case with
many of the Entomostraca, the young present a very different
appearance from the adult animals; and they are so exactly like the
young of <i>Chirocephalus</i>, that with difficulty are they distinguishable
one from the other. The ova of other species are furnished with
thick capsules, and imbedded in a dark opaque substance, presenting
a minutely cellular appearance, and occupying the interspace between
the body of the animal and the back of the shell; this is called the
ephippium. The shell is often beautifully transparent, sometimes
spotted with pigment; it consists of a substance known as chitine,
impregnated with a variable amount of calcium carbonate, which
produces a copious effervescence on the addition of a small quantity
of a strong acid to the water in which the shell is immersed. When
boiled, Artemi&aelig; turn red as their congeners, lobsters. Their shells
may be said to consist of two valves united at the back, resembling
the bivalve shell of a mussel, or simply folded at the back to appear
like a bivalve, but are really not so; or they may consist of a
number of rings or segments. The body of Cypris presents a reticulated
appearance, somewhat resembling cell structure. Entomostraca
should be narcotised and prepared for examination under the microscope
as directed by Mr. Rousselet at pages 345, 346.

<h2 id="PART_II_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>Arthropoda&mdash;Insecta.</h3>

<p><i>Distinctive Characters of Insects.</i>&mdash;The term Insect, although
originally and according to the meaning of the word correctly
employed in a wide sense to embrace all those articulate creatures
in which the body is externally divided into a number of segments,
including, of course, flies, butterflies, beetles, bugs, spiders, scorpions,
crabs, shrimps, &amp;c., is now by common consent used in a much more
restricted sense to apply only to such of these animals as have six
walking legs. Insects belong to a class of Arthropoda, and are
distinguished by having the head, chest, and abdomen distinctly
marked out and separable; by having not more than three pairs
of legs in the adult state; by having the legs borne by the thoracic
segments only; by having usually two pairs of wings; by the
possession of trache&aelig;, or air-tubes, as respiratory organs; and by
being provided with a single pair of antenn&aelig;, or feelers. The
insect class is one exhibiting uniformity of type and structure.
Extreme variations are no doubt seen within certain limits, but
these variations are sharply marked off from the groups we
have been previously considering. The examination of insects may
be pursued according to a defined order, and it will be found that
no class of animals will afford the microscopist a more wonderful
field of observation and a greater variety of interesting objects
than that of the insect tribes.</p>

<p>In the insect, as in the crustacean, the hard parts of the body
form an outer and protecting covering, and also serve for the
attachment of muscles. The casing, however, in insects is purely of
a chitinous, or horny nature, and has in its composition only a trace
of calcium carbonate. Each somite, or joint of the body, is usually
composed of six pieces; the upper, or dorsal half of each segment is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">584</span>
named the tergum, the lower half the sternum, the side pieces
pleura, the sternum being further sub-divided into epimeral and
espisternal pieces. The body as a whole consists of some twenty
segments, of which five or six form the head, the thorax of three
joints, while the abdomen may number from nine to eleven. The
head segments are united to form apparently a single mass, and the
appendages of this region are modified for sensory purposes, and also
serve as cutting and masticatory organs. The appendages of the
head, examined in order, will be found to consist of eyes, antenn&aelig;,
or feelers, and organs of the mouth. The antenn&aelig; of insects rarely
exceed two in number, but these present great variations in form and
size. In their simplest form they exist as straight jointed filaments,
but in many insects they are forked, in
others club-shaped, while in others they
mimic forms of vegetation, and for the
most part are extremely interesting objects
for the microscope.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_384" src="images/fig_384.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 384.&mdash;Vertical section of
cornea of Eye of Fly.</p></div>

<p>The principal use of these antenn&aelig;
is that of organs of touch, but it is
quite probable that they may subserve
other functions, as of taste or even
hearing. The eyes of insects consist of
either a pair of <i>ocelli</i>, or of a great
number, when they are termed compound eyes, formed of an aggregation
of external hexagonal facets and lenses, and nerve filaments,
all of which have a distinct connection with the mass of ganglia
recognised as the brain, as will be seen in <a href="#fig_384">Fig. 384</a>, a section of the
eye of a fly. The number of facets varies very greatly in these compound
eyes; ants, for example, have fifty facets, flies two thousand
or more, and butterflies as many. Dr. Hooke counted seven
thousand, and Leuwenhoeck as many as twelve thousand in the
eye of a dragon fly. The eyes of some insects are supported on
short stalks or pedicles, but these are never movable, as, for example,
in Stalk-eyed crustaceans.</p>

<p>The organs of the mouth in insects present a striking homology
or similarity in their fundamental structure. Two chief types of
mouth are found. The biting or masticatory, as in beetles, includes
a labium or upper lip, a pair of mandibles or lower jaws, a pair of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">585</span>
lesser jaws or maxill&aelig;, which bear one or two pairs of palpi, and a
lower lip or labium, also with palpi. This latter and primitive
condition of the labium is seen in Orthropterous insects and some
Neuroptera. Other structures occurring in those of the mouth are
the ligula, this being sometimes divided, as in bees, into three lobes,
of which the two outer are the paragloss&aelig; and the middle process
the lingua or tongue. There is a second form of mouth, termed the
suctorial. This is seen in Lepidoptera (butterflies), and is adapted for
extracting the pollen and juices of flowers, and in which the palpi
are greatly developed, and form two hairy pads or cushions, between
which the proboscis is coiled up when at rest. Thus we find in
the Lepidoptera the same fundamental condition of mouth as in
some Coleoptera. In Hymenoptera (wasps and bees), a variety of
mouth is found which presents a combination of the masticatory
with the suctorial types. The labium and mandibles exist as in
the beetle, the maxill&aelig; being developed to form long sheaths protecting
the labium, which now takes the form of a tongue. In
Hemiptera (bugs and their allies), the mandibles and maxill&aelig; exist
as sharp lancets, while the labium forms a protective sheath. In
the Diptera (flies, gnats, &amp;c.), the labium undergoes a great
development, and forms a very prominent tongue, the other parts
of the mouth being developed simply as sheaths to the labium. See
Figs. 389 and 390.</p>

<p>The thorax or chest of insects consists of three segments, named
from before backwards: the prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax.
The first bears the anterior pair of legs; the mesothorax, the second
pair of legs and the first pair of wings; and the metathorax, the
third pair of legs and second pair of wings. The last joints of the
leg constitute the tarsus or foot-claws. The nervures of the wings
are in reality hollow tubes, and are extensions of the spiracles, or
respiratory apertures.</p>

<p>The muscles of insects lie concealed beneath the integument; they
are not gathered into distinct bundles as in the higher animals,
although they exhibit in many cases a striated or striped structure.
This is well seen in some of the beetle tribe, the water-beetle in
particular. In certain larv&aelig; the muscles are exceedingly complicated.
Lyonnet found in the larva of the goat-moth, two hundred and
twenty-eight muscles in the head alone, and in the whole body
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_586">586</span>
no less than three thousand nine hundred and ninety-three. The
muscular power of insects is, relatively to the size of the body, very
great. The flea, for instance, leaps two hundred times its own
height. There are beetles weighing a few grammes that will escape
from a pressure of from twenty to thirty ounces.</p>

<p>Professor Sch&auml;fer infers that the structure of the wing-muscles of
insects furnishes the key to the comprehension of the more intricate
muscular structure of vertebrates. The sarcode element, however,
is not made up of a bundle of rods, but of a continuous sarcous
element, readily made out by staining with h&aelig;matoxylin. This
substance is then seen to be pierced by minute tubular canals, and
the longitudinal striation of muscle is due to this canalisation.
The whole is connected and enclosed by a membrane of extreme
delicacy.</p>

<p>The digestive system of insects varies with their habits and food.
In Stylops, bee-parasites, and in young bees living on fluids, the
intestine ends in a blind sac. There are three coats of structure
throughout the digestive system. The œsophagus or gullet is provided
with a crop in flies, bees, and butterflies; a true analogue of the
gizzard in birds. There is in some respects a curious likeness between
the conformation of the digestive organs of birds and that of insects.
No true liver, but salivary glands in the mouth have been made out;
the heart lies dorsally, and consists of a pulsating sac divided into
compartments, and the fluid flows through it towards the head,
whence it circulates freely to other parts of the body. Each trachea
is an elastic tube formed of two delicate membranes, between
which the spiral filament is coiled up, and is of sufficient density
to prevent the collapse of the tube by the movements of the
body. These trache&aelig; are distributed throughout the muscular
tissue and the whole of the body. Thus the insect, like the bird,
may be said to breathe in every part of the body, and is in this
way rendered light and buoyant for flight. The air is admitted
to the trache&aelig; by apertures termed spiracles, which the insect
can close at will, and these are distributed to the number of eleven
on each side of the body. The nervous system consists of a chain
of ganglia or nerve-knots, which unite towards the head to form
a single cord, as seen in the section made through the spider
(<a href="#fig_409">Fig. 409</a>).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587">587</span></p>

<p>The reproduction of all insects takes place by ova, and they are
di&aelig;ceous&mdash;that is, have two distinct sexes. In some few instances,
as that of Aphides, or plant-lice, we have the peculiar phenomenon
of parthenogenesis, the process of reproduction being performed by
imperfect wingless females. These bring forth living young ones,
which begin to feed the moment they are born, and constitute a
viviparous brood; in other cases females lay eggs, and the process
proceeds in the ordinary way, and nearly all the year round. The
former is provided with a lancet-like beak for piercing and sucking
the juices of the leaf, and a pair of curious honey-tubes. Insects
generally undergo a transformation or metamorphosis in passing
from the egg to the adult stage. While within the egg the body
may be seen to become segmented, and in the course of time&mdash;in
such insects as flies, bees, beetles, and butterflies&mdash;issue forth from
the egg as larv&aelig;, or caterpillars. This worm-like creature makes
for itself an investing case or cocoon, in which it passes into the
pupa stage of its existence. Within the pupa case a wonderful
transformation takes place; the larval body being literally broken
down by the process of histolysis, while its elements are rebuilt
and transformed into that of the <i>imago</i>, or perfect insect. In
grasshoppers, crickets, dragon-flies, bugs, &amp;c., the metamorphosis
is incomplete (hemimetabolic). Some few lower insect forms (lice,
spring-tails, &amp;c.) undergo no change of the kind, and in no way differ
from the adult except in size. These are termed ametabolic insects.
Others again, as the cockchafer and gold beetle, pass three years in
the larval stage. Development in all cases is arrested or retarded
by cold. Reaumur kept a butterfly pupa for two years in an ice-house,
and it exhibited no tendency towards a change until removed
to a warm temperature.</p>

<p>From the short natural history of insect life I have endeavoured
to sketch out, it will have been surmised that insects offer a wide
field of research, and an almost endless number of objects of
interest for the microscope. The variety of material is great,
and the structure and adaptation of means to an end is of the
most fascinating kind. Most cabinets abound in preparations
gathered together with some care and mounted with all the skill
at the command of the collector, affording, as a rule, as endless an
amount of pleasure to the tyro as to the more practised entomologist.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">588</span>
It may be surmised, then, that to enter fully into a
description of the several parts of insect structure would require
a volume<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> of very large bulk, and occupy months and years. I
will, therefore, take some points of interest in the structural characteristics
of insects, and take them in the order in which they have
already been brought to notice. The head, eyes, and other appendages
of these insects we are more or less acquainted with.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_385" src="images/fig_385.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="hang">Fig. 385.&mdash;A tangential
or side section of Eye of
Fly, with palp or pads
protruded.</p></div>

<p>We will take for examination a typical member of Muscid&aelig;, a
family embracing a large and varied assortment of species, among
which the house-fly and the blow-fly are the best known forms.
<i>Musca domestica</i> needs no description. An interesting part of the
house-fly to the microscopist is the wonderful
component parts of the head. On examination
we find a couple of protuberances, more
or less prominent, and situated symmetrically
one on each side. Their outline at the base is
for the most part oval, elliptical, circular, or
truncated; while their curved surfaces are
spherical, spheroidal, or pyriform. These
horny, round, and naked parts are the
corne&aelig; of the compound eye of the fly, and
they are appropriately so termed, from the
analogy they bear to the larger transparent
tunics in the higher classes of animals. They
differ, however, from the latter, as when
viewed by the microscope they display a
large number of hexagonal facets, which
constitute the medium for the admission of
light to several hundred simple eyes. Under an ordinary lens, and
by reflected light, the entire surface of one cornea presents a beautiful
reticulation, like very fine wire gauze, with minute papilla, or
at least a slight elevation, in the centre of each mesh. These are
resolved, however, by the aid of a compound microscope, and with a
power of from 80 to 100 diameters, into an almost incredible number
(when compared with the space they occupy) of minute, regular,
geometrical hexagons, well defined, and capable of being computed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">589</span>
with tolerable ease, their exceeding minuteness being taken into
consideration.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_386">Fig. 386</a> represents a vertical section of the eye, showing the
hexagonal faceted arrangement of cylindrical tubes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

(Magnified &times; 160.)</p></div>

<p>In this section it appears to be questionable whether the normal
shape of the lenses is not round, assuming the hexagonal shape
during the process of growth in consequence of their agglomeration.
The corneal surface can be peeled off, and if carefully flattened out and
mounted it will be seen that each lens is not a simple lens, but a
double-convex compound one, composed of two plano-convex lenses
of different densities or refracting power joined together.</p>

<p>Experiments made on the eyes of insects, and also of crustace&aelig;,
show that in the insect a real and reversed image of external
bodies is formed in each ommatidium; it coincides with the internal
face of the crystalline cone in immediate contact with the retina.
Although small, the retinal image is distinct and subtends an angle of
nearly forty-five. In the same way in the crustacean, the crystalline
lens forms on the retinula a reversed image, but the refractive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">590</span>
media have a longer focus, and the retinal membrane is not connected
with the lens, the interval being filled up by a substance
analogous to the vitreous of vertebrates. In both cases it would appear
that light does not act directly on the rods; these latter can only
receive impressions through the intermediary retinal cells. The
retinal images of arthropods, as might have been surmised, are much
less perfect than those of the higher orders; on the other hand, their
eyes seem to be better adapted for seeing objects in relief and the
movements of bodies. The shyness of butterflies and moths is
certainly an inherited instinct as
a protection against danger from
their many enemies.</p>

<p>In the accompanying <a href="#fig_387">Fig. 387</a>,
<small>A</small> is a vertical section of the eye
of <i>Melolontha vulgans</i>, the fan-like
arrangement of the facets,
together with the transparent
pyramidal gathering of the retinal
rods proceeding towards the
brain; <small>B</small> is a few of the corneal
tubes more highly magnified, the
darker portion representing the
pigment layer of the corneal tubes. In <a href="#pl_vi">Plate VI</a>., No. 133, the
under surface of the head and mouth of the “Tsetse” fly, <i>Glossina
morsitans</i>, is shown. The proboscis of this fly is long and prominent,
and the antenn&aelig; are peculiar, inasmuch as the third segment
is long, and produced almost as far as the flagellum, which is furnished
with barbed hairs along its outer surface only. Although
this fly barely equals the blow-fly in size, it is one of the greatest
pests to the domestic cattle of Equatorial Africa. The palpi, although
arising from two roots, are seen joined together when the fly is at
rest, but when in the act of piercing or sucking they divide and the
sheath is thrown directly upwards. The palpi are furnished on their
convex sides with long and sharply-pointed dark-brown set&aelig; or hairs,
while the inner concave sides, which are brought into contact with
the proboscis, are perfectly smooth and fleshy. Three circular
openings seem to indicate the tubular nature of what in the house-fly
is a fleshy, expanded, and highly-developed muscular proboscis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">591</span>
(seen in <a href="#fig_388">Fig. 388</a>, <i>Musca domestica</i>). The proboscis (labium) forms
the chief part of the organ, dilates into wonderful muscular lips,
and enables the insect to employ the tongue as a prehensile organ.
The lips are covered with rows of minute set&aelig;, directed a little
backwards and arranged rather closely together.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 388.&mdash;Proboscis of House-fly, <i>Musca domestica</i>. (The small circle indicates

<p>There are very many rows of these minute hairs on each of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">592</span>
the lips, and from being arranged in a similar direction are
employed by the insect in scraping or tearing delicate surfaces.
These hairs are tests for the best of high powers. It is by means
of these that it teases human beings in the heat of summer, when
it alights on the hand or face, to sip the perspiration as it exudes
from the skin. The fluid ascends the proboscis, partly by a sucking
action, assisted by the muscles of the lips themselves, which are
of a spiral form, arranged around a highly elastic, tendinous, and
ligamentous structure, with
other retractile additions for
rapidity and facility of
motion.</p>

<p class="hang">Fig. 389.&mdash;Spiral structure of Tongue of
House-fly, from a micro-photograph made

<p>The beautiful form of the
spiral structure of the tongue
should be viewed under a
high magnifying power, when
it will be seen that no continuing
spiral structure really
exists; each ring, apparently
detached, does not extend
quite round; their action
is that of sucking tubes.
Fluids are evidently drawn
up through the entire fissure
caused by the opening between
the ends of the whole series of rings. It may well be
pronounced a marvellous structure. The mounting of the tongue
must be done with a considerable amount of care to show this structure,
imperfectly represented in my woodcut.</p>

<p>These insects are of some service in the economy of nature, by
their consumption of decaying animal matter, found about in quantities
ordinarily imperceptible to most people, and that would not be
removed by ordinary means during hot weather. It was asserted by
Linn&aelig;us that three flies would consume a dead horse as quickly as
a lion. This was, of course, said with reference to the offspring of
such three flies; and it is quite possible the assertion may be correct,
since the young begin to eat as soon as hatched, and a female blow-fly
will produce twenty thousand living larv&aelig; (one of which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_593">593</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_594">594</span>
represented in <a href="#pl_vi">Plate VI</a>., No. 141). In twenty-four hours, each will
have increased in weight two hundred times, in five days it attains to
its full size, and changes into the pupa, and then to the perfect insect.</p>

<p>In the drone-fly (<i>Eristalis tenax)</i>, the mouth organs are larger than
in the house-fly, and differ in many respects. The tongue is split
up for a certain distance, and then again united, as represented in
<a href="#fig_390">Fig. 390</a>. The labium, mandibles, and maxill&aelig; are converted into
well-developed lancet-shaped organs; these both pierce the skin of
animals, and form tubes by which their blood may be sucked up.
Next to the maxillary palpi a couple of lancets are seen to project out;
these again are associated with two other instruments, one resembling
in appearance a two-edged sword, and a peculiar one with pincers or
cutting teeth at the extremity. It is very peculiar, and resembles
an instrument used in surgery for enlarging the wound, and in this
case to increase the flow of blood. This remarkable compound
piercing apparatus of the drone-fly is of exquisite finish, and must
strike the observer with amazement, while it greatly transcends the
work of human mechanism. The fleshy tongue itself projects some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_595">595</span>
distance from the apparatus described, and is furnished with set&aelig;
or hairs, shorter and fewer in number than those of the house-fly,
and while its spiral structure is not so fully developed, its retractor,
muscles, and ligaments are even more so.</p>

<p>The further development of the mouth organs must be looked
for in other members of the insect tribe, when it will be seen many
assume a more or less modified form of structure, that, for example,
in Hymenoptera (the bee and wasp), in which insects the mouth
and tongue are divided into lobes which are used to extract the
nectary (as Linn&aelig;us termed it) from the plants on which they feed.
The tongue in most species is capable of extension and contraction.</p>

<p>In <a href="#fig_391">Fig. 391</a> the under-surface of the wasp’s tongue is shown,
together with its two pairs of antenn&aelig;, and pair of brushes on either
side, for brushing off the gathered pollen and honey from the broad
tongue. It is amply provided with muscular structure. The antenn&aelig;,
or feelers, are as curious in form as they are delicate in structure.
Those of the male differ from those of the female.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_596">596</span></p>

<p>Both the bee and the wasp are armed with an exceedingly venomous
sting, as is well known. This structure takes the form of a well-adapted
mechanical contrivance, and is a weapon of offence as well
as of defence. The sting consists of two barbed needle-points, of a
sufficient length to pierce the flesh to some depth. From the peculiar
arrangement of their serrated edges their immediate withdrawal cannot
take place, and it is this circumstance, with the drop of poison injected
into the open wound, that renders their sting of the most painful
and irritating kind. The gland containing the poison is contained
in a minute sac situated at the root of the piercing apparatus. In
<a href="#fig_392">Fig. 392</a> is shown the sting of the wasp and the bee.</p>

<p>Very many insects are provided with instruments for boring into
the bark or solid wood itself. The female Cynip
bores into the oak-apple for the purpose of
depositing her egg. The larva, when full grown,
eats its way out of the nut, and drops to the
ground, where it attains the form of the perfect
fly (<a href="#fig_393">Fig. 393</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p class="hang">Fig. 393.&mdash;Female
Gall-fly and Larva.</p></div>

<p>There are numbers of species living exclusively
upon the leaves of plants, to which they
do much damage by the excrescences or galls
they form. Each tree seems to be infested by
its own species of gall-mite, the so-called <i>nail-gall</i> of the lime being
caused by a species named <i>Phytoptus tibi&aelig;</i>. These galls take the
form of a pointed column, standing erect on the upper side of the
leaf. Galls of much the same structure occur in the sycamore,
maple, elm, and various fruit trees.</p>

<p>The gnat (<i>Culex pipiens</i>) is furnished with a sting curiously constructed
(<a href="#fig_394">Fig. 394</a>), and enclosed in a perfectly clothed sheath covered
throughout by scales or feathers. This is folded up when not in use.
The mouth is provided with a complete set of lancets for piercing the
flesh; after having inflicted a severe wound, it injects an acid poison
through the proboscis. The scales of the gnat vary in structure
accordingly as these are found on the wing, the body, or the proboscis.
A magnified wing is shown at No. 2, <a href="#fig_394">Fig. 394</a>, and a magnified scale
from the proboscis at No. 3. In <a href="#fig_405">Fig. 405</a>, Nos. 3 and 5, more
highly magnified wing and body scales are given. The proboscis is
protected on either side by antenn&aelig; and feelers.

<p>The giant-tailed wasp, <i>Sirax gigas</i>, is furnished with an even more
curious mechanical boring apparatus (<a href="#fig_395">Fig. 395</a>) than its congeners.
This is a boring ovipositor, skilfully contrived for piercing the bark
of trees, in which the insect deposits her eggs, and where the larva,
when hatched, will find an ample supply of food to carry it through
this stage of existence. The boring tube, it will be seen, is a
perfect muscular structure (<i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>a</i>, and <i>x</i>); in short, it is an endless
form of drill, well known to the mechanic, such as is employed in
fine work for drilling holes. The females are of some size, and may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_598">598</span>
be surprised and taken in the act of boring through the bark of the
pine tree, for which they have a preference.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p>There is also a species of the broad-bodied saw-fly, <i>Lyda campestris</i>.
These bore the Scotch fir, and deposit their eggs. The larv&aelig; from
these eggs, when hatched out, feed upon the pine-needles, first spinning
a fine web to conceal their work of depredation.
A better known saw-fly, <i>Abraxas
grossulariata</i>, plays havoc among our
gooseberry trees. The female is provided
with a curious mechanical apparatus as
an ovipositor, with which she cuts into
the thicker under-leaf of the plant. This
penetrating and cutting tool consists of a
double-saw (<a href="#fig_396">Fig. 396</a>) of elaborate construction,
which when not in use is kept
concealed in a long narrow case situated
beneath the abdomen. It is further protected
by two horny plates. The saws
pass out through a deep groove so arranged
that the saws work side by side backwards
and forwards, without a possibility of
running out of the groove. When the
cut is made, the four are drawn together
and form a central canal, through which
an egg is forced into the leaf. The cutting
edges of the saws are provided with about
eighteen or twenty teeth; these have sharp
points of extreme delicacy, and together
make a serrated edge of the exact form
given to the finest and best-made surgical saws of the present day.
In the summer-time the proceedings of the female insect may be
witnessed, and the method of using this curious instrument seen, by
the aid of a hand magnifier. These insects are not easily alarmed
when busy at work.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 396.&mdash;Saws of the Gooseberry-fly (<i>Abraxas grossulariata</i>).</p></div>

<p>Before bringing my remarks on proboscides of insects to a conclusion,
attention must be given to that of the honey bee (<i>Apis
mellifica</i>), and its curious accessories. The mouth of bees exhibits
a combination of the suctorial and the masticatory form of oral
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_599">599</span>
apparatus. Thus the labial, or upper lip, and the mandibles, or
large pair of jaws, are well developed, while the maxill&aelig;, or lesser
pair, are elongated to form a tubular organ, through which, together
with the tongue, the flower juices, “honey-dew,” may be sucked up.
The labium, lower lip, is also rather prolonged, and the palpi, or
organs of touch, with which it is endowed form a useful protective
apparatus. The mandibles are employed by bees in the construction
of their abodes, while the suctorial portion of the mouth is devoted
to the reception of nourishment and to prehension. The sting of
the bee, already noticed, is in fact an ovipositor, the female alone
being provided with this weapon as an egg-depositing organ, although
better known as an <i>aculeus</i> or sting; but it forms no part of the
oral apparatus (as shown in <a href="#fig_397">Fig. 397</a>). The proboscis itself will be
seen to be curiously divided; the divisions are elegant and regular,
beset with numerous set&aelig; or hairs. The two horny outside lancets
are spear-shaped and partially set with short hairs; at the base
of each is a hinge articulation; this permits of considerable motion
in several directions, and is much used by the busy insect for
forcing open the more internal parts of flowers, thus facilitating the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_600">600</span>
introduction of the proboscis. The two shorter feelers are closely connected
with the proboscis, and terminate in three-jointed articulations.
The structure of the proboscis is so arranged that it can be enlarged
at the base, and thus made to contain a greater quantity of the
collected honey-dew; at the same time it is in this cavity the nectar
appears to be converted into pure honey. The proboscis tapers off
to a little nipple-like extremity, and at its base is seen two shorter
and stronger mandibles, from between which is protruded a long and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_601">601</span>
narrow lance-like tongue, the whole being most curiously connected
by a series of strong muscles and ligaments. The basal or first
joint of the hind leg in the neuter or working bee is developed into
an enlarged form of pocket, used by the insect for conveying the
pollen of flowers and the propolis to the hive. Indeed, both the
tibia and the first joint of the tarsus are broadened out into plates,
but the two sides of the plates are differently furnished. On one
side is a thick coating of hairs, those on the tarsus taking the form
of a brush, evidently used for brushing out the pollen, as these
special developments are not found on the hind legs of the drones
or of the queen.</p>

<p>The wax used in the formation of cells is a secretion that exudes
through certain portions of the body of the bee, since it is
found in little pouches situated on the under part of the body, but
it is not brought home ready for use. The walls of the cells are
strengthened when completed by a kind of varnish, already referred
to as the propolis, collected from the buds of poplar and lime trees,
and this is spread over the walls of the cell by that wonderful pair
of broad spatul&aelig;, represented in the drawing.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_602">602</span></p>

<p>Many interesting variations will be found in the legs and feet of
flies, as well as in those of other orders of insects (Lepidoptera). One
or two typical forms are represented in <a href="#pl_vi">Plate VI</a>., and in <a href="#fig_398">Fig. 398</a>.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_399" src="images/fig_399.jpg" alt="" />
<p>Fig. 399.&mdash;Sucker on the leg of
Water-beetle. (The dot in the

size.)</p></div>

<p>The tarsus, or foot of the fly (<a href="#fig_398">Fig. 398</a>), consists of a deeply
bifid, membranous structure, <i>pulvillus</i>; anterior to its attachment
to the fifth tarsal joint, or the upper surface, are seated two claws,
or “tarsal ungues”; these are freely movable in every direction.
These ungues differ greatly in their outline, size, and relative
development to the tarsi, and to the bodies of the insects possessing
them, and in their covering; most are naked over their entire surface,
having however a hexagonal network
at their bases, which indicates a rudimentary
condition of minute scale-like
hairs, such as are common on
some part of the integument of all
insects. Flexor and extensor muscles
are attached to both ungues and
flaps; the flaps are either corrugated
or arranged on the ridge and furrow
plan, in other cases they are perfectly
smooth on their free surface, while
others are covered with minute scale-like
hairs. The thickness of the
divided membrane on the blow-fly
does not exceed the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2000</sub>th of an
inch at the margin; they somewhat
increase in thickness towards the point of attachment. Projecting
from the flap are organs which have been termed “hairs,” “hair-like
appendages,” “trumpet-shaped hairs.” These are doubtless the immediate
agents in holding on to a smooth surface, as that of glass, and
are termed “tenent-hairs,” in allusion to their office. The under
surface of left forefoot of <i>Musca vomitoria</i> is shown with tenent-hairs
(<a href="#pl_vi">Plate VI</a>., No. 140); <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are more magnified hairs, <i>a</i> from
below, <i>b</i> from the side. No. 142 is the left forefoot of <i>Amara
communis</i>, showing the under surface and form of tenent appendages,
one of which is seen more magnified at <i>a</i>; No. 143, under surface
of left forefoot, <i>Ephydra riparia</i>. This fly is met with in immense
numbers on the surface water in salt marshes. It does not possess
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_603">603</span>
the power of climbing glass; this is explained by the structure
of the tenent-hairs; the central tactile organ is also very peculiar,
the whole acting as a float, one to each foot, to enable the fly to
rest on the surface of the water; <i>a</i> is one of the external hairs,
No. 135, under surface of left forefoot of <i>Cassida viridis</i> (tortoise-beetle),
showing the bifurcate tenent appendages, one of which is
given at <i>a</i> more magnified. These, in ground beetles, are met with
only in males, and are used for sexual purposes. The delicacy of
the structure of these hairs in the fly and the elastic membranous
expansion of the foot are marvellous. When the fly is climbing,
a minute quantity of some glutinous fluid is exuded, so that the
tubular nature of the tenent-hairs hardly admits of a doubt.</p>

<p>“At the root of the pulvillus, or its under surface, is a process, which
in some instances is short and thick, in others long and curved, and
tapering to its extremity (Scatophaga), setose (Empis), plumose
(Hippoboscid&aelig;), or, in one remarkable example (Ephydra), closely
resembling in its appearance the very rudimentary pulvillus with
which it is associated. Just at the base of the fifth tarsal joint,
on its under surface, there is present, in Eristalis, a pair of short,
very slightly curved hairs, which point almost directly downwards.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>Tenent-hairs are usually present in some modification or other.
It is really difficult to name a beetle which has not some form
of them; the only one I yet know that seems to me really to
possess nothing of the kind is a species of Helops, living on
sandy heaths. I suppose the dense cushion of hairs on the tarsi
to be for the protection, simply, of the joints to which they are
attached. I have detected them on the tarsal joints of species of
Ephydra, and on the first basal tarsal joint of the drone of the
hive-bee. A very rudimentary form of tenent-hairs is present on
the under surface of some of the tree-bugs (Pentatomid&aelig;), which
have in addition a large, deeply-cleft organ at the extremity of the
tarsus; this appears to be a true sucker.</p>

<p>When walking on a rough surface, the foot represents that of a
Coleopterous insect without any tenent appendages. The ungues
are always attached to the last joint of an insect’s tarsus. They
are not attached to the fifth tarsal joint of a Dipterous insect,
neither are they attached to the fifth tarsal joint of a Hymenopterous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_604">604</span>
insect, but to the terminal sucker, which again, in this great order,
is a sixth tarsal joint, membranous, flexible, elastic in the highest
degree, retractile to almost its fullest extent within the fifth tarsal
joint&mdash;a joint modified to an extraordinary degree for special
purposes.</p>

<p>In plantula of Lucanus, with its pair of minute claws, the ungues
are hairs modified for special purposes; and they have the structure
of true hairs. The sustentacula of Epeira, the analogous structures
on the entire under surface of the last tarsal joints in Pholcus, the
condition of the parts in the hind limbs of Notonecta, in both its
mature and earlier conditions, as well as in Sarcoptes, Psoroptes, and
some other Acari, all may be cited in proof of this fact. The
various orders of insects have, for the most part, each their own
type of foot. Thus there is the Coleopterous type, the Hymenopterous
type, the Dipterous type, the Homopterous type, &amp;c.; each
so very distinctive, that in critical instances they will sometimes
serve at once to show to which order an insect should be referred.
Thus, amongst all the Diptera, I have as yet met with but one
subdivision which presents an exception to the structure described.
This exception is furnished by the Tipulid&aelig;, which have the
Hymenopterous foot. With hardly an exception, then, I believe the
form of foot described will be found universal among the Diptera.</p>

<p>It may be desirable to add a few words on the best plan of conducting
observations on the feet of insects. Their action should be
studied by placing the insect under the influence of chloroform.
It is of advantage to carefully preserve the parts examined, and for
this purpose Deane’s medium or glycerine jelly suits very well;
some of the more delicate preparations, however, can only be kept
unchanged in a solution of chloride of zinc. The plan of soaking in
caustic potash, crushing, washing, putting into spirits of wine and
then into turpentine, and lastly into Canada balsam, is perfectly
useless, excepting in rare instances where points connected with the
structure of the integument have to be made out. Of course, the
parts should be viewed from above, from below, and in profile, in
order to gain exact ideas of their relations. The binocular microscope
diminishes the difficulties which formerly had to be encountered,
as by its aid many parts may be clearly viewed without
preparation of any kind.

<p>Moths and butterflies supply the microscopist with some of the
most beautiful objects for examination. What can be more wonderful
in its adaptation than the antenna of the moth (represented in
<a href="#fig_400">Fig. 400</a>, No. 1), with a thin, finger-like extremity almost supplying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_606">606</span>
the insect with a perfect and useful hand, moved throughout its
extent by a muscular apparatus of the most exquisite construction.
The tongue of butterfly (No. 2) is evidently made for the purpose
of dipping into the interior of flowers and extracting the juices; this
act is assisted by a series of fine muscles. An enlarged view of
a portion is given at No. 3; see <a href="#pl_vi">Plate VI</a>., Nos. 132 and 133,

<p class="hang">Fig. 402.&mdash;Magnified portions of the
trachea of the Hydrophilus, showing
spiral tubes.</p></div></div>

<p>The inconceivably delicate structure of the maxill&aelig; or tongues
(for there are two) of the butterfly, rolled up like the trunk of an
elephant, and capable, like it, of every variety of movement, has
been carefully examined and described by Mr. Newport. “Each
maxilla is convex on its outer surface, but concave on its inner; so
that when the two are united they form a tube, <i>haustellium</i>, by
their union, through which fluids may be drawn into the mouth. The
inner or concave surface, which forms the tube, is lined with a
very smooth membrane, and extends throughout the whole length
of the organ; while that of each maxilla is hollow in its interior,
apparently forming a tube ‘in itself,’ but this is not so; the mistake
has arisen from the existence of large trache&aelig;, or breathing tubes,
in the interior of the proboscis. In some species the extremity of
the haustellium is studded externally with a number of minute
papill&aelig;, or fringes&mdash;as in <i>Vanessa atalanta</i>&mdash;in which they become
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_607">607</span>
small elongated barrel-shaped bodies, terminated by smaller papill&aelig;
at their extremities. On alighting on a flower, the insect makes
a powerful expiratory effort, by which the air is expelled from the
interior air-tubes, and from those with which they are connected in
the head and body; and at the moment of applying its proboscis to
the food, it makes an inspiratory effort, by which the central canal
in the proboscis is dilated, and the food ascends it at the same
instant to supply the vacuum produced; and thus it passes into
the mouth and stomach, the constant ascent of the fluid being
assisted by the action of the muscles of the proboscis, which continues
during the whole time that the insect is feeding. By this
combined agency of the acts of respiration and the muscles of the
proboscis we are also enabled to understand the manner in which
the humming-bird sphynx extracts in an instant the honey from a
flower while hovering over it, without alighting; and which it
certainly would be unable to do were the ascent of the fluid entirely
dependent upon the action of the muscles of the organ.”</p>

<p>The trach&aelig;al or respiratory system of insects varies, or rather is
found to exist in modified forms to suit their varied conditions of
life. While in the larval stage the breathing apertures are seen to
recur at intervals on each side of the abdomen (as that of the silkworm,
<a href="#fig_401">Fig. 401</a>), thus ensuring a continuous supply of air to the
circulating fluids throughout the whole body. These spiracles are
usually nine or ten in number, and consist of a membranous ring of
an oval form. The air-tubes are exquisitely composed of two thin
membranes, between which a delicate elastic thread or spiral fibre
is interposed, forming a cylindrical opening and keeping the tube
in a distended condition, thus mechanically preserving the sides from
collapse or pressure in their passage through the air, which otherwise
might occasion suffocation. <a href="#fig_402">Fig. 402</a> represents the double
spiral arrangement of a portion of a trachea of Hydrophilus, which
ensures both elasticity and strength.</p>

<p>There are other points of interest confined to the water-beetle
tribe, among the more striking of which is the foreleg of the <i>Dytiscus
marginalis</i>. Here the first three joints of the tarsus are expanded into
a broad surface, and fringed throughout with curved hairs. From the
surface of these spring a number of short hairs, with cup-like discs at
their extremities, one of which is seen highly magnified in <a href="#pl_vi">Plate VI</a>.,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_608">608</span>
No. 142. These are so cup-like in form that they have been hitherto
described as “suckers,” but it is believed they are simply a special
apparatus for the development of the hairs seen on the leg and foot
of the beetle. Another curious example occurs in the Gyrinus, or
whirligig-beetle. The front pair of legs are of the ordinary kind,
but the under pair are furnished with expanding paddles. The
trochanter, femur, and tibia, are flat plates of a triangular shape,
pointed at their outer angles, from which the apex springs. But
the tarsus is jointed on the inner angle of the furthermost end of
the tibia, and each of its four joints expands into a flat paddle blade.
In the accompanying <a href="#fig_403">Fig. 403</a> one paddle is seen expanded, the other
closed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_403" src="images/fig_403.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 403.</p>

<p>1. Leg of Gyrinus, Whirligig, paddle shown expanded. 2. Paddle closed up.</p></div>

<p>These paddles are adapted with much precision to ensure the most
effectual application of the propelling power; as the beetle strikes
out in the act of swimming, the membranous expansion described
enables it to move about with great rapidity; upon the legs being
drawn back towards the body, the membrane closes up, and thus
offers no resistance to the water. The eyes are not the least
curious part of the merry little beetle: the upper section is fitted
for seeing in the air, and is adapted to the upper or superior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_609">609</span>
part of the head; the lower portion, for seeing under the water,
being placed at a lower angle, a thin division only separating
the two.</p>

<p><i>Wings of Insects.</i>&mdash;These exhibit variety of form and structure, as
well as of beauty of colouring. At an early period the orders of
insects were mainly founded upon these interesting appendages.
The Orthoptera were the straight wings; the Neuroptera the
nerved; the Trichoptera the hairy wings; the Coleoptera the
cased or sheathed wings; the Diptera the two wings; the Hymenoptera
the married wings; and the Lepidoptera the scaled wings.
A number of wings are small and membranous, and may be mounted
dry for examination under the microscope. Others are better seen
mounted in benzol-balsam. The elytra, iridescent wing cases of the
diamond, and other beetles, as well as the wings of the more highly
coloured butterflies, make pretty objects mounted dry for opaque
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_610">610</span>
illumination by the Lieberk&uuml;hn or reflector. The thicker horny
cases of other members of the beetle tribe require long soaking, as
described in a former chapter.</p>

<p>The wings of moths and butterflies are covered with scales or
feathers, carefully overlapping each other, as tiles are made to cover
the tops of houses. The iridescent variety of colouring on insects’ wings
arises from the peculiar wavy arrangement of the scales. Figs. 404
and 405 are magnified representations of a few of them. No. 1,
a scale of the <i>Morpho menelaus</i>, taken from the
side of the wing, is of a pale-blue colour; it
measures about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>120</sub>th of an inch in length, and
exhibits a series of longitudinal stri&aelig; or lines,

stri&aelig;, giving it very much an appearance of

<p class="caption">Fig. 406.&mdash;<i>Podura villosa</i>, male and female,

<p>The <i>Tinea vestianella</i>,
clothes-moth, is furnished
with unique scales. Small
and destructive as this
moth is, it suffers much
from a parasitic mite, and
from which it is unable
to free itself.</p>

<p>The Podura scale (Fig.
405), with its delicate
transparent membrane and
curiously inserted “notes
of admiration,” as they
were called, was long believed to be an excellent test object for the
highest powers of the microscope, but I believe it is no longer regarded
in that light: indeed, most insect scales have declined in the value
and estimation of the skilled microscopist. This is in part due to the
improvements made in the objective. The high-angled glasses have
cleared up obscure points in the structural characters of the minuter
forms of life, and the scales of insects are no longer found to be
difficult test objects for the modern objective of a Zeiss or a Powell
to resolve. Nevertheless, the scale of the Podura belonging to the
order Thysanura, a curious little insect commonly known by the name
of springtail, usually found living in most obscure places, and too
small to attract attention, is not likely to be entirely thrust aside.
The springtails (Collembola) are furnished on the under-side of the
first abdominal segment with a curious tube or sucker, from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_612">612</span>
orifice of which glandular process a secreted viscid matter is protruded;
they are remarkable also from the fact that in most of them no trace
of a tracheal system has yet been discovered. The eyes when present
are in the form of simple or grouped ocelli, the antenn&aelig; number six
joints, and the abdomen has but six segments, often only three. The
forked tail is a curious process turned forward and attached to one
of the tender segments and held in position under the body; when
released it springs back and bounds up to a very considerable height.
<a href="#fig_406">Fig. 406</a> represents <i>Podura villosa</i>. There are several species, one
of which (<i>P. aquatica</i>) is found floating in patches on pools of water
on bright summer days.</p>

<p><i>Lepisma saccharina</i> belongs to the same genus as Podura. This
minute springtail derives its name from having been discovered
in old sugar-casks. It has a spindle-shaped body covered with
silvery scales, long used as test objects. The sides of the abdomen
are furnished with a series of appendages with long bristle-like set&aelig;,
or hairs, at their extremities. The head is concealed under a prothorax,
the antenn&aelig; are long, and the maxillary palpi are either five
or seven-jointed, and very conspicuous, to enable them to cut the
dry wood on which they principally feed. The scales must be
mounted under thin cover-glasses; oblique illumination shows up
some portions to advantage, while central light from an achromatic
condenser and a wide-angled objective renders their markings more
distinct. Portion of a scale more highly magnified is shown in
<a href="#fig_405">Fig. 405</a>.</p>

<p><i>Eggs of Insects</i> (<a href="#pl_vi">Plate VI</a>., Nos. 124-139).&mdash;In form, colour, and
variety of design, the eggs of insects are more surprisingly varied
than those of the feathered tribes; but as from extreme smallness they
escape observation, an acquaintance with their structure is not so
familiar as it might be. Although the eggs of the bird tribe differ
much in their external characteristics, they closely resemble each
other while yet a part of the ovarian ova, and prior to their detachment
from the ovary. At one period of their formation all eggs
consist of three similar parts:&mdash;1st. The internal nucleated cell,
or germinal vesicle, with its macula; 2nd. The vitellus, or yolk-substance;
and 3rd. The vesicular envelope, or vitelline membrane.
The germinal vesicle is the first produced, then the yolk substance,
which gradually envelops it, and the vitelline membrane, the latest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_613">613</span>
formed, incloses the whole. The chemical constituents of the egg
are the same in all cases, albumen, fatty matters, and a proportion
of a substance precipitable by water. The production of the
chorion, or shell membrane, does not take place till the ovum has
attained nearly its full size, and it then appears to proceed, in part
at least, from the consolidation over the whole surface of one or
more layers of an albuminous fluid secreted from the wall of the
oviduct.</p>

<p>The embryo cell is so directly connected with the germinal vesicle
that at a certain period it disappears altogether, and is absorbed into
the germinal yolk, or rather becomes the nucleus of the embryo,
when a greater degree of compactness is observed in the yolk, and
all that remains of the germinal vesicle is one or more highly
refracting fat globules and albuminoid bodies. Towards the end
of the period of incubation, the head of the young caterpillar is said
to lie towards the dot or opening in the lid, termed the micropyle,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>
from its resemblance to a small gate, or opening through which the
larva emerges forth as a butterfly.</p>

<p>The germinal vesicle is comparatively large and well-marked
while the egg is yet in the ova-sac. By preparing sections after
Dr. Halifax’s method,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> we find that the germinal vesicle in the bee’s
egg is not situated immediately near or even below the so-called
micropyle, but rather more to the side of the egg; just in the
position which the head of the embryo is subsequently found to
occupy at maturity.</p>

<p>The egg membrane, or envelope, of all the Lepidoptera is composed
of three separate and distinct layers: an external slightly
raised coat, tough and hard in its character, a middle one of united
cells, and a fine transparent vitelline lining membrane, perfectly
smooth and homogeneous in structure, imparting solidity, and giving
a fine iridescent hue to the surface. The germinal vesicle is of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_614">614</span>
proportionately large size for the egg, and its macula is at first
single, then multiple. In the egg of the silkworm the outer membrane
is comprised of an inner reticulated membrane of non-nucleated cells,
in the outer layer the cells are arranged in an irregular circular
form, also non-nucleated, with minute interstitial set&aelig; or hairs
projecting outward.</p>

<p>The outer surface of the egg-shell of <i>Coccus Persic&aelig;</i> is covered
by minute rings, of which the ends somewhat overlap. These rings
are thought to be identical in their character with the whitish
substance which exudes through pores on the under-side of the
body; it is more than probable that a succession of layers of rings
fully accounts for the beautiful prismatic hues they present viewed
as opaque objects under the microscope, and illuminated by
Lieberk&uuml;hn or side-condenser. This white substance, it should
be observed, forms a part of the intimate structure of the egg-shell,
and is in nowise affected by methylated spirit or dilute
acids. Sir John Lubbock<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> states that in the greenish eggs of
Phryganea, “the colour is due to the yolk-globules themselves. In
Coccus, however, this is not so; the yolk-globules are slightly yellow,
and the green hue of the egg is owing to the green granules,
which are minute oil globules. When, however, the egg arrives at
maturity, and the upper chamber has been removed by absorption,
these green granules will be found to be replaced by dark-green
globules, regular in size, and about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8000</sub>th of an inch in diameter,
and which appear to be in no way the same in the yolk of Phryganea
eggs.” Another curious fact has been noticed, which partially bears
on the question of colour: the production of parasite bodies within
the eggs of some insects. In the Coccus, for instance, parasitic cells
of a green colour occur, “shaped like a string of sausages, in length
about the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2000</sub>th of an inch by about the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>7000</sub>th in breadth.”</p>

<p>The eggs of moths and butterflies present many varying tints
of colour; in speaking of this quality I do not restrict the term
solely to those prismatic changes to which allusion has been made,
and which are liable to constant mutations according to the accident
of the rays of light thrown upon them; but I more particularly
refer to the several natural transitions of colour, the prevailing tints
of which are yellow, white, grey, and a light-brown. In some eggs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_615">615</span>
the yellow, white, and grey are delicately blended, and, when viewed
with a magnifying power of about fifty diameters, and by the aid of
the side-reflector (parabolic-reflector), exhibit many beautiful combinations.
The more delicate opalescent, or rather iridescent, tints
appear on the eggs of insects, while those of the feathered tribes
furnish no like example. The egg of the mottled umber moth, <i>Erannis
defoliaria</i> (<a href="#pl_vi">Plate VI</a>., No. 137), is in every way very beautiful. It
is in shape ovoid, with regular hexagonal reticulations, each corner
being studded with a knob or button; the space within the hexagon
is finely punctated, and the play of colours is exquisitely delicate.
In this egg no micropyle can be seen. The egg of the thorn moth,
<i>Ennomos erosaria</i> (<a href="#pl_vi">Plate VI</a>., No. 138), is of an elongated brick-looking
form, one end of which is slightly tapered off, while the
other, in which the lid is placed, is flattened and surrounded by
a beautifully white-beaded border, having for its centre a slightly
raised reticulated micropyle. The empty egg-shell gives a fine
opalescent play of colours, while that containing the young worm
is of a brownish-yellow.</p>

<p>The egg of the straw-belle moth, <i>Aspillates gilvaria</i> (<a href="#pl_vi">Plate VI</a>.,
No. 139), is delicately tinted, somewhat long and narrow, with sides
slightly flattened or rounded off, and irregularly serrated. The top
is convex, and the base a little indented, in which are seen the lid
and micropyle. The young worm, however, usually makes its way
through the upper convex side: the indentation represented in the
drawing shows the place of exit.</p>

<p>An example of those eggs possessing a good deal of natural colour
is presented in that of the common puss-moth, <i>Cerura vinula</i>, a large
spheroidal-shaped egg, having, under the microscope, the appearance
of a fine ripe orange; the micropyle exactly corresponds to the
depression left in this fruit on the removal of the stalk. The surface
is finely reticulated, and the natural colour a deep orange.</p>

<p>The egg of the mottled rustic moth, <i>Caradina morpheus</i> (No. 124),
is subconical, and equally divided throughout by a series of ribs,
which terminate in a well-marked geometrically-formed lid. The
egg of the tortoise-shell butterfly, <i>Vanessa urtic&aelig;</i> (No. 125), is
ovoid and divided into segments, the ribs turning in towards the
micropyle. The common footman, <i>Lithosia campanula</i> (No. 126),
produces a perfectly globular egg covered with fine reticulations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_616">616</span>
of a delicate buff colour. The egg of the shark moth, <i>Cucullia
umbratica</i> (No. 127), is subconical in form, with ribs and cross-bars
passing up from a flattened base to the summit, and turning over to
form the lid. No. 136 is the egg of blue argus butterfly, <i>Polyommatus
argus</i>. That of the small emerald moth, <i>Jodis Vernaria</i> (No. 134),
is an egg of singular form and beauty&mdash;an oval, flattened on both
sides, of silvery iridescence, and covered throughout with minute
reticulations and dots. It is particularly translucent, so much so
that the yellow-brown worm is readily seen curled up within. The
lid or micropyle is not detected until the larva eats its way out
of the shell. It should be noted that
the series of eggs in <a href="#pl_vii">Plate VII</a>. are
somewhat over-coloured, and consequently
lose much of their natural
transparency. The eggs of flies and
parasites also present much variety in
form, colour, and construction. Many
of their eggs are provided with a
veritable lid, which opens up with a
hinge-like articulation. This lid is seen
in the egg of bot-fly, <a href="#pl_vi">Plate VI</a>., No. 144,
from which the larva is just escaping;
No. 146, egg of Scatophaga; No. 147,
egg of parasite of magpie.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> Still more
remarkable in the delicate and beautiful
forms are some of the parasities which infest birds in particular:
<a href="#pl_vi">Plate VI</a>., No. 145, the egg of parasite of pheasant; No. 147, that
of the magpie, while that of the peacock is curiously interesting.
In <a href="#fig_407">Fig. 407</a> the larv&aelig; of the horn-bill are seen just about to emerge
from their eggs.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_407" src="images/fig_407.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 407.&mdash;Larv&aelig; of the Hornbill
emerging from eggs.</p></div>

<p>The larv&aelig; of most Hymenoptera are footless grubs, furnished with
a soft head, and exhibiting but little, if any, advance upon those of
Diptera (<a href="#pl_vi">Plate VI</a>., No. 141). In the saw-fly, however, the larva,
instead of being as above described, a mere footless maggot, presents
the closest resemblance to the caterpillar of the Lepidoptera; it is
provided with a distinct head, with six thoracic legs, and in most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_617">617</span>
cases from twelve to sixteen pro-legs are appended to the abdominal
segments.</p>

<p>One other conspicuous object represented in <a href="#pl_vi">Plate VI</a>., No. 128, is
the maple Aphis, also known as the leaf-insect, averaging in size about
the one-fiftieth of an inch in length. Although recognised and
described under the name of the leaf-insect, nothing was known of
its origin and history, with the exception of what the Rev. J. Thornton
published in 1852, and to whom we owe its re-discovery on the leaves
of the maple. Subsequently it attracted the attention of the Dutch
naturalist, Van der Hoeven, who regarded it as the larval form of a
species of Aphis, and named it Periphyllus. It has more recently
engaged the attention of Dr. Balbiani and M. Siguoret, whose united
investigations will be found in “Comptes Rendus,” 1867. These
observers assigned it definitely to Aphis. A brown species is also
met with during a great part of the year feeding upon the young
shoots of the maple. The female produces two kinds of young, as do
all the genus Aphis, one normal the other abnormal; the first are
alone capable of reproducing their species, while the latter retain
their original form, which is not changed throughout their existence.
They increase so slowly in size that it may appear doubtful whether
they eat, the mouth being rudimentary; they undergo no change;
do not acquire wings, and their antenn&aelig; always retain the five joints
peculiar to all young Aphides before the first moult. Neither are
they all of the same colour, some being of a bright green, as represented
in <a href="#pl_vi">Plate VI</a>., while others are of a darker, or brownish-green
colour. The brown-green embryos differ from the adult female only
in those characters analogous to all other species, and this chiefly
with regard to the minute hairs, which are long and simple. In the
green embryos, in the place of set&aelig;, the body is surrounded by
transparent lamell&aelig;, oblong in shape. These scales not only cover
the body, but also the anterior portion of the head, the first joint of
the antenn&aelig;, and the outer edge of the tibi&aelig; of the first pair of legs.
The dorsal surface in these insects is covered with a mosaic of hexagonal
plates, very closely resembling the plates of the carapace of
the tortoise. In this particular my artist has fallen into a slight
error. Another peculiarity is that the body is much flattened out,
and looks so much like a scale on the surface of the leaf that it
requires considerable practice, as well as quickness of sight, to detect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_618">618</span>
the young maple Aphis. One of the lamell&aelig; is seen highly magnified
at <i>c</i>, and a tenent-hair at <i>b</i>. The antenn&aelig;, tapering off towards the
apex, are serrate on both edges, and terminate in a fine lancet (shown
at <i>a</i>), with which it penetrates the leaf of the plant. Beneath the
insertions of the antenn&aelig; is a complex form of sucking mouth, and
on either side of the head are two brilliant scarlet-coloured eyes.</p>

<p><i>Aphides</i>, as is well known, live upon the juices of plants, which they
suck, and when they occur in great numbers cause considerable
damage to the gardener and farmer. Many plants are liable to be
attacked by swarms of these insects, when their leaves curl up, they
grow sickly, and their produce is either greatly reduced or utterly
ruined. One striking instance is presented
in the devastation caused by
the hop-fly (<i>Aphis humuli</i>).</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="fig_408" src="images/fig_408.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 408.&mdash;<i>Aphrophora spumaria</i>,
Cuckoo-spit.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The frothy substance; <i>b.</i>
The pupa.</p></div>

<p>The <i>Aphrophora bifasciata</i>, common
frog-hopper, is a well-known garden
pest. The antenn&aelig; of this insect are
placed between the eyes, and the
scutellum is not covered; the eyes,
never more than two in number, are
occasionally wanting. These pests
are furnished with long hind legs, that enable them to perform most
extraordinary leaping feats. The best-known British species is the
cuckoo-spit, froth-fly (<a href="#fig_408">Fig. 408</a>). The names cuckoo-spit and froth-fly
both allude to the peculiar habit of the insect, while in the larva
state, of enveloping itself in a kind of frothy secretion, somewhat
resembling saliva.</p>

<p><i>Arachnid&aelig;.</i>&mdash;In this class of insects, spiders, scorpions, and mites
are included, all of which belong to a sub-class of Arthropoda, and
are appropriately placed between the Crustacea on the one hand and
the Insecta on the other. The highest Crustaceans have ten feet,
the Arachnid&aelig; eight, and insects six. The Arachnid&aelig; are wingless,
have no antenn&aelig;, and breathe by means of tracheal tubes, or pulmonary
sacs, these performing the function of lungs. As a rule they
have several simple eyes, have no proper metamorphosis, and they
are essentially predaceous, the females being larger than the males.
Most of the Arachnid&aelig; live on insects, and may therefore be regarded
in the light of a friend to the florist and gardener.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_619">619</span></p>

<p>The <i>Epeira diadema</i> is the best known member of the species; in
summer spiders abound on every shrub, and spin out their wonderful
webs from branch to branch.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_409" src="images/fig_409.jpg" alt="" />

<p>The body, seen in my illustration, <a href="#fig_409">Fig. 409</a>, in section, consists
of two parts; the foremost is the cephalothorax, or head, upon which
is mounted four pairs of eyes (two of which are seen in section),
while to the thorax is attached eight jointed well-developed legs
terminating in feet, with claws adapted for climbing and holding on.
The other half consists, of the abdomen, together with spinnerets
and glands, which secrete the fluid out of which the web is spun,
and this, although it hardens to some extent on exposure to the
air, retains its viscid nature for the purpose of entangling its prey.
The spinnerets are the most interesting feature in the anatomy of the
Epeira (Figs. 410 and 411).</p>

<p>Five kinds of spinning glands are found in spiders. The glandul&aelig;
aciniformes are those which consist of a proper tunica and an epithelium;
these exhibit in all parts the same reaction to staining agents.
The glandul&aelig; pyriformes consist of a tunica proper and an epithelium,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_620">620</span>
which in their lower parts (or those near the efferent ducts) stain
more deeply than the upper. The glandul&aelig; ampullace&aelig; and glandul&aelig;
tubuliformes have similar coverings, the latter terminating in
a large spool. The glandul&aelig; aggregat&aelig; have a wide and branched
lumen, the efferent duct of which is provided with cells and an accessory
piece, which draws out to a tip. All the glands have secreting
portions, which serve as collecting cavities for the spinning material.
The spools are two-jointed basal and one-jointed accessory pieces.
In addition to the five glands enumerated, there are also lobate and
cribelleum glands; these are variously distributed, and exercise
different functions, one set preparing the so-called moist filaments
from the moist droplets, another spins the egg-cocoon, as nearly all
spiders envelop their eggs in a covering of silken threads and store
them up in some sheltered place awaiting the warm weather of spring
to hatch them out. The bag that holds the eggs is not one of the
least curious efforts of skill and care. The mother uses her body as
a gauge to measure her work, precisely as a bird uses her body
to gauge the size and form of its nest. The spider first spreads
a thin coating of silk as a foundation, taking care to have this
circular by turning its body round during the process. In the same
manner it spins a raised border round this till it takes the form of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_621">621</span>
cup; it is at this stage of the work the female begins to lay her
eggs in the cup, and not content to fill it up to the brim, she also
piles up a heap as high as the cup is deep. Here, then, is a cup
full of eggs, the under half covered and protected by the silken sides
of the cup, but the upper still exposed to the air and the cold.
She now sets to work to cover this; the process is similar to the
preceding&mdash;that is, she weaves a thick web of silk all round the top,
and instead of a cup-shaped nest, like those of the bird tribe, the
whole partakes of the form of a ball
much larger than the body of the
spider.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_411" src="images/fig_411.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 411.&mdash;Spinnerets of Spider
greatly enlarged.</p></div>

<p>The eight legs and feet of the
spider (one only is represented <a href="#fig_410">Fig.
410</a>, No. 4) are curiously constructed.
Each foot, when magnified, is seen
to be armed with strong horny
claws, with serrations on their under-surface.
By this arrangement the
spider is enabled to regulate the
issue of its web from the spinnerets.
In addition, a remarkable comb-like
claw is provided for the purpose of
separating certain threads which
enter into the composition of the
delicate web, so that everything is arranged and planned in the
most geometrical order, while the mouth or jaws with their two
movable poison-fangs convert the Arachnid&aelig; into formidable and
dangerous foes. The maternal industry and instincts of spiders, the
ballooning habits of others, the cave dwellers, with their limited
vision, combined with an increased delicacy of touch and hearing,
their disguise of feigned death when a strong enemy approaches, are
all of the most interesting character.</p>

<p>One of the more remarkable, the <i>Argyroneta aquatica</i> (diving
spider), weaves itself a curious little bell-shaped globule, which it
takes with it to the bottom of the water, whither it retires to
devour its prey. Notwithstanding its aquatic habits, this, like
the rest of its species, is fitted only for aerial respiration; it
therefore carries down, entangled amongst the hairs of its body,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_622">622</span>
a small bubble of air. This contrivance presents us with the earliest
form of diving-bell.</p>

<p><i>Mites and Ticks</i> constitute a group which for diversity of structure,
number of species and individuals, and minuteness of size, has no
equal. The typical genus of the family&mdash;Ixodid&aelig;&mdash;being wholly
parasitic in their habits, are so modified in organisation, so marked
by degeneration, that some authors have proposed to remove them
into a class by themselves. One leading character distinguishes the
whole: the abdomen rarely presents a trace of segmentation, but is
confluent with the cephalothorax, the fusion between the two being so
complete that, as in the harvest spiders belonging to Palpatores, the
anterior sternal plates of the
abdomen are thrust far forward
between the cox&aelig; of
the cephalothoracic limbs.
As in Arachnid&aelig;, however,
the mouth is adapted for
sucking, but the jaws are
often partially united, and
form, with a plate termed
the <i>epistome</i> and the labium,
a beak. The mandibles are
either pincer-like, or simply
pointed at the tip, forming
piercing organs; the palpi have their basal segments, or maxill&aelig;,
united, which form a conspicuous plate, or <i>hypostomes</i>, constituting
the floor of the mouth. These organs are often seen to be separated
from the rest of the cephalothorax by a membranous joint, and
constitute a kind of head, the <i>capitulum</i>. In most cases no trace of
special respiratory organs can be found. Another characteristic of
value in separating ticks from harvest-spiders is that in the former
the young undergo a metamorphosis in the course of growth, being
hatched as six-footed larv&aelig;, and acquiring later in life a fourth pair of
legs.</p>

<p>The Acari&aelig; include a number of families, all distinguished by the
position of the respiratory stigmata and the form of the mandibles
and palpi. In the velvety mites (Trombidiid&aelig;), the integument is
soft and covered with variously-coloured fine hairs, and the legs are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_623">623</span>
adapted for walking, running or swimming. The latter live in fresh-water
ponds, creeping over the leaves of aquatic plants. The fresh-water
mites (<i>Atax spinipes</i>, <a href="#fig_412">Fig. 412</a>) swim about freely by means
of vigorous strokes of their legs, which act as oars. In the adult
the body is more or less spherical, and usually of a bright red or
greenish colour. The males of one species have a curious blunt
tail-like prolongation from the hinder end of the abdomen. The eggs
are laid in the spring on the stems of water plants, and the six-footed
larv&aelig; when hatched attach themselves to water-bugs (Nepa) or water-beetles
(Dytiscus) by means of a large sucker developed on the front
of the head.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 413.&mdash;<i>Ixodes ricinus</i> or Sheep-tick (under surface). The small circle
encloses one life-size.</p></div>

<p>Of all the Acari, the best known and most troublesome are
those belonging to the family Ixodid&aelig;; these infest the whole animal
creation. They are furnished with a long cylindrical beak, armed
with recurved hooks, formed of the two mandibles above and the
long slender labium below. They have no eyes, nor apparently any
dermaploptic sense, but there are various seemingly sensitive set&aelig;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_624">624</span>
distributed over the body and on the appendages. The whole of the
mites will be found suitable objects for the study of development, as
the process is slow and their eggs do not require much care. The
segmentation of the eggs differs; some of the cells are distinguished
by their large nuclei, which stain feebly by carmine. During the
cleavage of the egg no division of the so-called yolk has been observed,
but later on this breaks up into
several minute pieces.</p>

<p>The accompanying <a href="#fig_413">Fig. 413</a> shows
the under surface of the body and
the mouth parts of the common
English dog and sheep tick, <i>Ixodes
ricinus</i>, with its six formidable
legs. The upper surface is shown
in <a href="#fig_415">Fig. 415</a>; the head (<i>capitulum</i>)
and mouth organs in <a href="#fig_414">Fig. 414</a>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>,
<i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, together with the four segments
of the palpi; <i>h</i> the labial
process armed with hooks forming
the lower side of the beak, and <i>i</i>
indicating the tips of the two mandibles
forming the upper side, and
projecting beyond the apex of the
labium. By means of this beak,
which is thrust to its base into the
integument, the tick adheres firmly
to its host, and in detaching them
care must be taken that the head is
not left behind buried in the skin.
This tick is found in all stages of
growth; the females, gorging themselves with blood, swell up to the
size of a pea, as seen in <a href="#fig_413">Fig. 413</a>, but the male, formerly regarded
as a distinct species, is of a much smaller size. In distribution these
pests are almost cosmopolitan, and in tropical countries they grow to
much greater dimensions, the females sometimes attaining the size of
a large gooseberry.</p>

<p>The family of true mites is that of the Sarcoptid&aelig;; these are
either free or parasitic. They have no breathing organs; the palpi
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_625">625</span>
are basally fused to the rostrum, the mandibles are pincer-like, and
the tarsi are often furnished at their tips with a sucker. The most
familiar is the cheese mite, Tyroglyphus, which feeds upon decaying
matter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>The well-known cheese mite attains to a size plainly visible to
the naked eye, but when first hatched out from the egg (shown
in its several stages of development in <a href="#fig_417">Fig. 417</a>), requires a
moderate amount of magnification. Its growth, however, is rapid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_626">626</span>
and the young begin to feed as soon as they leave the egg. The
body is partially covered over by set&aelig;, or hairs, and the feet
terminate in hooklets, as seen in the full-grown acarus. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_627">627</span>
mandibles are cutting, but as a rule they prefer soft and partially-decayed
kinds of food. It also feeds upon damaged flour, sugar,
and other domestic articles. The <i>Dermestes lardarius</i>, one of the
minute beetle tribe (<a href="#fig_418">Fig. 418</a>), commits even greater depredations
among insect and other collections during the larval stage of its
existence.</p>

<p>Birds suffer much from mites living parasitically upon them
belonging to Sarcoptid&aelig;; these likewise infest mankind, and give
rise to a disease known as the itch (Fig.
416, No. 3). This malady and the irritation
accompanying it are caused by the
mite excavating tunnels under the skin. In
these the eggs are laid and hatched, and the
young then start burrowing on their own
account; their burrows are traced as whitish
lines on the surface of the skin.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_416">Fig. 416</a>, No. 4, <i>Demodex folliculorum</i>, is
another remarkable parasite found beneath
the skin; this is usually obtained from a spot where the sebaceous
follicles or fat glands are abundant, such as the forehead, the side
of the nose, and the angles between the nose and lip. If the part
where a little black spot or a pustule is seen be squeezed rather
hard, the oily matter there accumulated will be forced out in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_628">628</span>
globular form. This minute mite is less than one-fiftieth of an
inch in length; if it be laid on a glass slide, and a small quantity
of glycerine added to cause the separation of the harder portions,
the parasite in all probability will float out, and, by means of a
fine-pointed pencil or brush, can be transferred to a clean slide and
mounted in Canada balsam. An allied species is found in the skin
of dogs suffering from mange.</p>

<p>The Stylopid&aelig; are remarkable parasites, living upon the bodies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_629">629</span>
of wasps, bees, and bugs, and present a type of structure quite distinct
from beetles or the ticks described. The male (<i>Xenos peckii</i>,
<a href="#fig_420">Fig. 420</a>) is a winged insect with coarsely faceted eyes, large fan-shaped
wings, extremely small inconspicuous elytra, the two first thoracic
rings short, while the metathorax is elongated and covers the base
of the abdomen, and the hind legs are placed a long way behind the
middle pair. The female, on the other hand, is a grub-like creature,
without legs, wings, or eyes; she never leaves the body of her host,
and from her eggs active little larv&aelig; develop and get carried into
the nests of bees and wasps.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_420" src="images/fig_420.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 420.&mdash;<i>Xenos peckii.</i> 1. Male; 2. Female.</p></div>

<p>Mites are very numerous, differ in form, and are interesting objects
under the microscope. The body of the common flea (<a href="#fig_421">Fig. 421</a>) is
divided into distinct
segments, those about
the thorax being separated.
Although apterous,
the flea has the
rudiments of four wings
in the form of horny
plates on both sides of
the thoracic segments.
Its mouth consists of
a pair of sword-shaped
mandibles, finely serrated; these, with a sharp, penetrating, needle-like
organ, constitute the formidable weapons with which it pierces
through the skin.</p>

<p>The neck is distinctly separated, and the body covered with
scales, the edges of which are beset with short set&aelig;; from the head
project a short pair of antenn&aelig;, below which are a proboscis and
a lance-shaped cutting apparatus. On each side of the head a large
compound eye is placed; it has six many-jointed powerful legs,
terminating in two-hooked claws; a pair of long hind legs are kept
folded up when the insect is at rest, which, in the act of jumping, it
suddenly straightens out with great muscular force. The female flea
(<a href="#fig_421">Fig. 421</a>) lays a great number of eggs, sticking them together with
a glutinous secretion; the flea infesting the dog or cat glues its eggs
to the roots of the hairs. In about four days the eggs are hatched
out, and a small white larva or grub is seen crawling about, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_630">630</span>
feeding most actively. <a href="#pl_vi">Plate VI</a>., No. 141, is a magnified view of one
covered with short hairs. After nine or ten days the larva assumes
the pupa form; this it retains four days, and in nine days more it
becomes a perfect flea. The head of the flea found in the cat (<a href="#fig_415">Fig. 415</a>,
No. 3) somewhat differs in form from that of the species infesting
the human being; its jaws are furnished with more formidable-looking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_631">631</span>
mandibles, and from between the first and second joints behind the
head short strong spines project.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>Two small and obscure groups of the mites and ticks have been
associated with the latter, but for no better reason than that their
affinities are unknown. The first of these are the Tardigrada, or
bear animalcules, which comprise microscopical animals living in
damp, sandy, and mossy places; the body is long and oval in shape,
and possesses four pairs of bud-like unjointed appendages, each tipped
with claws: the last pair of legs project from the hinder part of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_632">632</span>
body. The mouth is much subdued, and only a trace of jaws is
found as a pair of stylets; there appear to be no organs of respiration
or circulation, and, unlike what obtains in all true Arachnida,
the sexes are united in each individual. These curious infusorial
creatures have been found by myself in an infusion of cow manure.</p>

<p><i>Injurious Insects.</i>&mdash;In describing some of the more interesting
points in connection with insect life, I have only quite incidentally
referred to the destructive habits of the larger number of insects
and the ravages annually inflicted, chiefly by the smaller parasitical
tribes, upon our cultivated crops of all kinds.</p>

<p>Here we have a wide field of research open to the microscopist,
whose investigations must be carried out systematically, day by day,
and for which a moderate power will effectually serve his purpose.</p>

<p>There are some ten or twelve species of injurious insects that
attack the hop plant. By way of example, I will select one of the
least known among them, the hop-flea, or beetle (<i>Haltica concinna</i>).
This is sufficiently minute to require the aid of the microscope, and
very closely resembles the turnip-flea proper, <i>H. nemorum</i>. Under
the microscope the former will be seen to differ considerably. Its
colour is brassy, whereas the colour of its congener is dusky or black,
and its wing-cases are striped. They both have wonderful powers of
jumping. <i>H. concinna</i> has a curious toothed formation of the tibia,
with a set of spines, while the tibia of the turnip-flea is without any
curve. It presents other points of difference. The hop-flea is, in fact,
a winged beetle, and passes the winter in the perfect state under
clods, tufts of grass, or weeds outside the hop-plantation, and here it
lays its eggs. In the early spring the larv&aelig; are hatched out as
a little white maggot, which immediately makes its way to the hop-plant
and burrows into the young leaves and feeds upon its tissues.
Here we have an insect taken at random from among thousands of
others of the most destructive kinds which annually destroy crops of
enormous value to the nation.</p>

<h2 id="PART_II_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>Vertebrata.</h3>

<p>The most complicated condition in which matter exists is where,
under the influence of life, it forms bodies with a structure of tubes
and cavities in which fluids are incessantly in motion, and producing
continuous changes. These have been rightly designated “organised
bodies,” because of the various organs they contain. The two
principal classes into which organised bodies have been divided are
recognised as vegetable and animal. It was Bichat who taught that
our animal life is double, while our organic life is single. In organic
life, to stop is to die; and the life we have in common with vegetables
never sleeps, and if the circulation of the fluids within the
animal body ceases for a few seconds, it ceases for ever. In the
vertebrate body, however, the combination of organs attains to the
highest development, in striking contrast with that of the class
we have previously considered, the Invertebrata, the animal kingdom
being divided into Vertebrates and Invertebrates.</p>

<p>The Vertebrata are distinguished from all other animals by the
circumstance that a transverse and a vertical section of the body
exhibits two cavities completely separated from one another by a
partition. A still more characteristic feature separates the one from
the other; it is the specialisation of the chief nervous centres, and
their peculiar relation to the other systems of the body.</p>

<p>The dorsal cavity of the body contains the cerebro-spinal nervous
system, the ventral, the alimentary canal, the heart, and usually
a double chain of ganglia; these pass under the name of the
sympathetic system. It is very probable that this sympathetic
nervous system represents, wholly or partially, the principal nervous
system of the Annulosa and Mollusca. In any case, the central
parts of the cerebro-spinal nervous system&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the brain and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_634">634</span>
spinal cord&mdash;would appear to be unrepresented among invertebrate
animals. Likewise, in the partition between the cerebro-spinal and
visceral tubes, certain structures which are not represented in
Invertebrates are contained. During the embryonic condition of all
Vertebrates, the centre of the partition is occupied by an elongated
cellular cylindrical mass, the notochord, or chorda dorsalis. This
structure persists throughout the life in some Vertebrata, but in
most it is more or less completely replaced by a jointed, partly
fibrous, cartilaginous, and bony vertical column. All vertebrate
animals have a complete vascular system. In the thorax and abdomen,
in place of a single perivisceral cavity, in communication with
the vascular system, and serving as a blood-sinus, there are one or
more serous sacs. These invest the principal viscera, and may or may
not communicate with the exterior, recalling in the latter case the
atrial cavities of the Mollusca. In all Vertebrata, except Amphioxus,
there is a single valvular heart, and all possess a hepatic portal
system, the blood of the alimentary canal never being wholly
returned directly to the heart by the ordinary veins, but being more
or less completely collected into a trunk (the portal vein), which
ramifies through and supplies the liver.</p>

<p>With reference to one other point of importance, the development
of the ova of Vertebrates, these have the same primary composition
as those of other animals, consisting of a germinal vesicle containing
one or more germinal nuclei, and included within a vitellus. But as
this forms a part of general anatomy, and as my object is simply
the investigation of the fundamental and microscopical structure of
animal organisms, I shall not further pursue the morphological part
of the subject, especially as so many excellent text-books are within
reach of the student who desires to fully acquaint himself with
precise information.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, then, the apparent diversity in the structure
of the vertebrate and the invertebrate and the various tissues of
which animals and vegetables are constituted, microscopical research
has satisfactorily demonstrated that all textures have their origin in
cells; in fact, when the formative process is complete, the animal cell
is seen to consist of the same parts and almost the same chemical
constituents as the typical cell of the plant&mdash;namely, a definite cell-wall
enclosing cell contents, of which the nature may be diverse, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_635">635</span>
the cell nucleus is precisely the same and is the actual seat and
origin of all formative activity. The cell and nucleus grow by
assimilation or intersusception, that is, by inflowing of nutrition
among all parts, the new replacing the old, yet maintaining its
original structure and composition. That which was once thought
special to animals is now found to be common to both plants and
animals: they are found to be alike fundamentally in internal
structure, and in the discharge of the mysterious processes of reproduction
and of nutrition, although the latter forms a convenient line
of separation. Life in plants goes on indefinitely; cuttings may be
taken without injury to their vigour and duration of life. The same
may be said of some of the lower forms of invertebrate life; for
example, the hydra, the anemone, and some other well-known animals,
may be cut up, divided into several parts, each one of which will
form a new animal, provided a nucleus be included in the section.
Nevertheless, the organisation of the amœba and the hydra is as
complete for its purpose as that of man for his, and the evidence of
continuity forbids the drawing of hard and fast lines, as was
formerly done between the two kingdoms, the animal and vegetable.
The amount of similarity or agreement in the organisation of animals
is various. Animals indeed differ from each other in slight points
only, for the discovery of which the microscope must be brought
into requisition. Living matter in its earliest stage and simplest
form appears to the naked eye as a homogeneous structure, but when
placed under the highest powers of the microscope, it is seen not
to be so.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most marked feature of the age has been the
increasing attention given to the study of the lower forms of life,
using their simpler structures and more diffuse phenomena to elucidate
the more general properties of living matter. To understand
life we must understand protoplasm. Of this there can be no doubt,
as we have seen in a previous chapter that a whole family, the
Monera, consists of this simple living, microscopic, jelly-like substance,
which has not even begun to be differentiated, as in the amœba,
which has as yet no special organs, and every speck becomes a mouth
or a stomach, and which can be turned inside out and shoot out
tongues of jelly to move and feel with. “Reproduction is the faculty
most characteristic of life, and sharply distinguishes the organic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_636">636</span>
from the inorganic.” It is, then, the corpuscles of protoplasm, called
cells (cellul&aelig;), which have so much interest for the physiologist,
and these, like the cytods, may form independent organisms, which
are then termed unicellular. Again, cells form other cells, and a
multicellular organism results, and goes on increasing in geometrical
progression. In the Vertebrata the cell retains its characteristic
spheroidal shape, as seen in <a href="#fig_423">Fig. 423</a>, and undergoes division by
virtue of its living protoplasmic mass.</p>

<p><i>Epithelial Cells.</i>&mdash;All free surfaces of the human body, both
internal and external, are to a very considerable extent covered by
epithelium cells. These cells are everywhere the same, but with
modifications in shape and arrangement. Epithelial cells are nucleated
and always joined by their surfaces or edges, without, on the external
surfaces, the intervention of connective tissue.</p>

<p>There are four essential varieties:&mdash;1. Tesselated; 2. Columnar;
3. Spheroidal; 4. Ciliated; in all of which the nucleus remains
remarkably uniform in its characters, is either round or oval, and
flattened out, measuring <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6000</sub>th to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4000</sub>th of an inch in diameter.
They are insoluble in acetic acid, colourless, or slightly tinted by the
structure with which they are in contact, and usually contain one
or more nucleoli with a few minute irregular granules, as represented
in <a href="#fig_424">Fig. 424</a>.</p>

<p>The simplest and most commonly distributed variety is the
tesselated, known also as the scaly, squamous, pavement, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_637">637</span>
flattened epithelium, always arranged in single layers, lining serous
cavities, many parts of the mucous membrane, and the interior
of ducts and blood vessels. Upon the external surface of the body
it occurs in superimposed layers, forming the “stratified epidermis.”
To obtain specimens of lamellar epithelium it is only necessary to
collect a little saliva, or pass a glass slide over the lining membrane
of the cheek, cover it with a thin cover glass, and examine it with
a &frac14;-inch objective. Pavement epithelium is the elementary structure
of hair, nails, and horn.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption">PLATE XIX.</p>
<img id="pl_xix" src="images/pl_xix.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="caption">ANIMAL TISSUES.</p></div>

<p>Columnar epithelium exists upon the mucous membrane of the
stomach, on the villi of the intestines, and in the several canals. It
occupies either a vertical or horizontal position, and may be detached
in rows, as shown in <a href="#pl_xix">Plate XIX</a>., No. 2, a section taken from the
intestine of a rabbit. This variety, when more highly magnified,
as in <a href="#fig_424">Fig. 424</a>, is seen to consist of club-shaped nucleated cells, the
thicker end being turned towards the surface. The protoplasm
of the cell is granular, and the presence of minute vacuoles and
fatty globules occupy a great part of the space. The nucleus is now
seen to contain a fine network. At times the outer end of the cell is
distended, as in <a href="#fig_3">Fig. 3</a>. This form of columnar epithelium (known
as the “goblet” cell) presents a close and remarkable resemblance
to the cilio-flagellate “collared” infusorial monad in its extended
“wine-glass” form.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Fig. 424.</p>

epithelium, from the intestine of a rabbit, showing central fat globules, and at str

<p>Spheroidal epithelium is confined to the closed cavities of the body,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_638">638</span>
and in the internal structure of the ducts of secreting glands. The
cells are, for the most part, circular, although some are flattened out
at the sides in which they are in contact with each other (<a href="#pl_xix">Plate XIX</a>.,
No. 1<i>a</i>). Specimens of this form may be taken from the internal
surface of one of the lower animals with a scalpel. The collected
matter must be placed in a drop of distilled water and examined
with a high power.</p>

<p>Ciliated epithelium is characterised by the presence of those fine
hair-like filaments (cilia) attached to the free surface of the cell.
During life, and for some time after death, the cilia are seen to
retain their constant waving motion. The cilia all move in one
direction and rhythmically, thus giving rise to the appearance of
a succession of undulations. Ciliated epithelium is found lining the
mucous membrane of the air passages and nasal ducts, and wherever
it is necessary to urge on a secretion by mechanical means, ciliated
epithelium exists. Specimens for examination are easily obtained
from the oyster, and with care will show the characteristic motion.
A portion of a gill separated from the mollusc will live on for
a considerable time if kept in a little of its natural secretion.
The parameci&aelig;, rotifera, and all the ciliata, are furnished with cilia
as a means of locomotion and obtaining sustenance. By snipping
off a small piece from the gills of the mussel, always accessible to
the microscopist, and covering it over with thin glass to prevent
evaporation of the animal juices, its cilia will continue to work for
hours.</p>

<p><i>Lymph and Blood</i>, <a href="#fig_425">Fig. 425</a> B, <i>a a</i>.&mdash;There are other cells in the
animal body which possess a certain amount of resemblance to those
confined to the more superficial structures&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the lymph, chyle, and
blood. These fluids present in one respect a physical uniformity of
composition, and a resemblance in the size of their characteristic
corpuscles. Chyle contains besides the corpuscles of lymph, a quantity
of minute granules which imparts a white colour to the fluid. Intermixed
are oil globules, free nuclei, and sometimes a few red blood discs.
Chyle may be had for microscopic examination by squeezing a little
juice from the lymphatic gland of a sheep just slaughtered.</p>

and fishes. <a href="#fig_102">Fig. 102</a> (page 143) is a microphotograph of a drop of
blood magnified 3,500 times; and <a href="#fig_425">Fig. 425</a>, A, shows both red and white
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_639">639</span>
discs drawn to scale, magnified 1,200 diameters. The red corpuscles of
human blood are distinguished by their clearly defined outlines and
dark centres. Each disc is biconcave in form, and hence the whole
surface cannot be focussed at the same time. When the circumference
is well illuminated the centre is dark, but by bringing the objective
nearer to the object, the concavity of the disc is brought into focus.
It generally happens that blood corpuscles, on being first drawn,
run together, and present the appearance of rolls of coins; or they
may be scattered about over the field. There is a considerable
difference in the form of the discs; they are circular in all mammals,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_640">640</span>
except the camel, dromedary, and llama, these being oval. In
profile blood corpuscles are biconcave, their investing membrane is
homogeneous and elastic, and will readily move along the smallest
capillary vessels. There is no trace of a nucleus in the blood-discs
of the adult Mammalia, while in size they bear no proportion
to the bulk of the animal in whose blood-vessels they circulate.
The corpuscles of Mammalia in general are like those of man in
form and size, being either a little larger or smaller. The most
marked exception is the blood of the musk-deer, in which the
corpuscles are of extreme smallness, about the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12000</sub>th of an inch in
diameter. In the elephant they are large, about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2700</sub>th of an inch
in diameter. The goat, among common animals, has very small
corpuscles, but they are, withal, twice as large as those of the musk-deer.
In the <i>Menobranchus lateralis</i> they are of a much larger size
than in any animal, being the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>350</sub>th of an inch; in the proteus, the
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>400</sub>th of an inch in the longest diameter; in the salamander, or
water-newt, <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>600</sub>th; in the frog, <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>900</sub>th; lizards, <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>1400</sub>th; in birds,
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>1700</sub>th; and in man, <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3200</sub>th of an inch. Of fishes, the cartilaginous
have the largest corpuscles; in gold-fish, they are about the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>1700</sub>th
of an inch in their longest diameter.</p>

<p>The large size of the blood discs in reptiles, especially in the
Batrachia, has been of great service to physiologists by enabling them
to ascertain many particulars regarding structure which could not
have been otherwise determined with certainty. The value of the
spectroscope in the chemical examination of the blood has been already
referred to. See page 252.</p>

<p>White corpuscles or leucocytes (<a href="#fig_425">Fig. 425</a>, I) differ materially from
the red. They are large, spheroidal, finely granular masses of about
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2800</sub>th of an inch in diameter. In a cubic millim&egrave;tre of human
blood there are about 10,000 white corpuscles. They have a lower
specific gravity than the red, have no cell-wall, and their substance
mainly consists of protoplasm. The internal granular appearance
is now believed to be due to a fine intercellular network having
small dots at the intersections of the web. In the meshes of the net
a hyaline substance is interspersed. They possess one or more nuclei;
these are seen on the application of a few drops of acetic acid. When
examined in a perfectly fresh state, especially if the glass slide be
placed on the warm stage of the microscope, they exhibit a spontaneous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_641">641</span>
change of shape, amœba-like, such movements being accordingly
termed amœboid. The movements referred to consist in the protrusion
of processes of protoplasm which are retracted and other
processes protruded as represented (<a href="#fig_425">Fig. 425</a>, I). Both in human
blood and in newts there are colourless corpuscles which contain
coarser granules than others; these are called granular corpuscles.
Some are shown near the amœboid bodies. The white corpuscles are
readily found in various tissues of the body, as in the lymphatic glands.
In inflammatory diseases these <i>leucocytes</i> pass through the walls of the
capillaries into the tissues, and form morbid products, pus-cells.</p>

<p>Sections of blood discs are made by dipping a fine needle in a drop
of blood as it exudes from a prick of the finger and drawing thin
lines across the glass slip, allowing time to dry, and then cutting the
lines across in all directions with a razor. The loosened portions
should be removed with a camel’s-hair brush.</p>

<p>In birds, the blood discs are oval in shape and possess a nucleus,
shown in <a href="#fig_425">Fig. 425</a> B, in the blood of the fowl; this is rendered more
apparent on adding a drop of acetic acid. The blood of fishes is
also oval and nucleated, rather more pointed than that of birds. In
reptiles generally the red blood discs are large, oval, nucleated bodies,
the white corpuscles still preserving their invariable circular form
and granular appearance. In the salamander and proteus the discs
attain to their greatest size. In the former they measure <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>700</sub>th of an
inch, and in the latter <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>400</sub>th.</p>

<p><i>Blood Crystals.</i>&mdash;In addition to the elements described, the blood
contains various crystalline forms, represented in <a href="#fig_425">Fig. 425</a>, C to H.
In connection with the micro-spectroscope (p. 253), the spectra of
certain blood crystals are given; although varying in different animals,
sufficient uniformity prevails as to render them characteristic. The
crystals are formed when a little blood is mixed with water on the
slide, allowing a short time for crystallisation. Near the edge of the
cover-glass, where crystals begin to form, they are more distinct, but
a high power is required for their examination. In human blood
the crystals are prismatic; in that of the guinea-pig, tetrahedral; in
the blood of the mouse, octahedral. Other forms may be obtained
by the aid of chemical reagents.</p>

<p>In human blood there are at least three distinct forms of crystals:
<i>H&aelig;matin</i> is formed in normal blood, is made visible on the addition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_642">642</span>
of a little water to blood, or by agitation with ether, so as to dissolve
the cell-wall of the blood corpuscles, and allow the contents to
escape. A drop of blood will furnish crystals large enough to be
seen with a moderate power. <i>H&aelig;matoidin</i> crystals are abnormal
products, found in connection with certain diseased conditions. These
crystals are seen as represented at D. <i>H&aelig;min</i> crystals must be
regarded as artificial chemical products, the result of treating blood
with glacial acetic acid; the acicular crystals at E, reddish-brown in
colour, are artificially produced.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Fig. 426.</p>

<p>1. White fibrous or non-elastic tissue; 2. Yellow fibrous elastic tissue.</p></div>

<p><i>Basement Membrane&mdash;Connective Tissue System.</i>&mdash;Connective or
areolar tissue is present almost throughout the whole of the human
body, and serves to connect the various organs with one another, as
well as to bind together the several parts. The muscles are surrounded
by a connective tissue sheath; this penetrates into their
substance, and binds together fasciculi and fibres. The same tissue
is present in the skin and the mucous membranes; it also forms a
sheath for the arteries, veins, and nerves. It is plentifully supplied
by blood-vessels, and nerves pass through its substance. Microscopically,
four different elements can be clearly made out:&mdash;1.
Connective tissue cells or corpuscles; 2. White fibrous tissue; 3.
Yellow fibrous tissue; 4. Ground substance.</p>

<p>On examining the connective tissue cells of young animals, various
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_643">643</span>
cells will be seen with fine granular contents, together with nuclei,
lying in spaces in the ground substance, some branched, others
flattened or rounded. Even tissues supposed to be homogeneous in
structure, are on staining seen to have connective tissue cells, such
as those represented in a section of the cornea of the eye (see p. 31).
In this case the connective tissue cells are termed corneal corpuscles;
the branched cells, it will be noticed, are united by branches.</p>

<p>The cells in the fibrous tissue of tendons are square or oblong, and
form continuous rows. White fibrous tissue is distributed throughout
the animal body, but in a variety of forms; it is found in the skin
and other membranes, and in all parts where strength and flexibility
are necessary. The structure of white and yellow fibrous tissues is
shown in <a href="#fig_426">Figs. 426</a> and <a href="#fig_427">427</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_427" src="images/fig_427.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 427.</p>

<p>1. White fibrous tissue lining the interior of the egg shell, with the calcium
carbonate removed by immersion in hydrochloric acid; 2. White fibrous tissue,
from the sclerotic coat of the eye.</p></div>

<p>White fibrous tissue presents silver-lustre bundles, running for
the most part in parallel directions through and over the muscles
and tendons. For examination under the microscope, obtain a fragment
of fresh meat cut in the longitudinal direction; place it in
water, and tease it out with needles as directed in a former chapter.
The smallest fragment will suffice for examination under a quarter or
one-sixth inch objective. These filaments are exceedingly minute, measuring
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3000</sub>th to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2500</sub>th of an inch in diameter, and do not interlace
through the bundles, although they intersect each other occasionally.
Transverse sections may be made by drying a piece of tendon until
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_644">644</span>
it becomes sufficiently firm to cut with a razor or microtome, and
mounted as a permanent specimen. From the cut ends of the fibres
small dark points will be seen, especially in the denser structure of
the tendons; these are termed “connective tissue corpuscles.”</p>

<p>Yellow elastic fibrous tissue is remarkable in contradistinction to
the white for its elasticity and capability of extension. It is found
on the coats of blood-vessels, between the vertebral arches, and
in quadrupeds it forms a strong elastic band, extending from the
occiput, throughout the spines of the vertebra, and enabling the
animal to support the head in the pendent position, without muscular
exertion. These fibres can only be separated from each other
with difficulty, and their elasticity is shown by a tendency to curl
up. These yellow fibres are somewhat coarser than the white, and
they remain unaffected by acetic acid of the ordinary strength.
Elastic tissue is a constituent of the skin, mucous, and serous
membranes, and of the areolar or cellular tissue.</p>

<p>In order to microscopically examine this structure, take a small
portion of the strong ligament of the neck of the ox, place it as
before in water, and tease it out with needles; place a fragment on
a glass slip, cover with a thin cover-glass, and submit it to a high
magnifying power. Transverse sections made as directed in the
case of white tissue will be seen to be hexagonal in form.</p>

<p><i>Adipose Tissue.</i>&mdash;Fat is found in many situations in the animal
body, and on examination is seen to consist entirely of vesicles,
distributed through a delicate membrane of connective tissue, shown
in <a href="#pl_xix">Plate XIX</a>., Nos. 4 and 5. On pressure, the circular or oval form
of the cells becomes polyhedral; occasionally the fatty acids in the
interior of the vesicles crystallise, and give rise to a star-like appearance.
For the examination of adipose tissue, take a portion of the
mesentery of any small animal&mdash;a mouse, or rat.</p>

<p><i>Retiform Tissue.</i>&mdash;Adenoid, or retiform tissue, consists of a delicate
network of connective tissue corpuscles, joining their branches
together. This forms the stroma or framework of lymphoid tissue.
It is found in connection with all the lymphatic glands, spleen, &amp;c.
<a href="#pl_xix">Plate XIX</a>., No. 3, <i>a b</i>, shows small sections of a lymphatic, together
with capillary vessels.</p>

<p><i>Muscular Fibre.</i>&mdash;There are two varieties of muscular fibre in
the body&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, striated, and non-striated. The striated is formed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_645">645</span>
in muscles attached to bony structures, as those of the arm and leg,
and in some of the soft structures, as the tongue, palate, œsophagus,
in short, all muscles under the control of the will. Striped
muscle is of a dull red colour and marked with peculiar longitudinal
furrows on its surface. Voluntary muscle consists of:&mdash;1, a connective
tissue sheath; 2, fasciculi; 3, fibres and sarcolemma; 4, discs,
fibrilla and sarcous elements. These are shown in connection with
other tissues in <a href="#pl_xix">Plate XIX</a>., Nos. 11 and 12, and also in <a href="#fig_428">Fig. 428</a>
(1, 2, 3).</p>

blood corpuscles distributed about &times; 200; 3. A fasciculus of muscular fibre from

<p>In <a href="#pl_xix">Plate XIX</a>., <a href="#fig_11">Fig. 11</a>, the muscular fibre taken from the tongue
of a lamb shows the continuity of the upper portion with the
connective tissue membrane. In <a href="#fig_12">Fig. 12</a>, a branching-out bundle of
muscular fibre, taken from the upper lip of the rat, is seen to end
in stellate connective cells. The delicate homogeneous sheath that
binds the fibres together is termed <i>sarcolemma</i>. This is readily seen
in prepared muscle of the frog and water-beetle, less plainly in man.
Each muscle is provided with a sheath of connective tissue; this
surrounds it, binds the fasciculi together, and supports the blood-vessels;
it is called the <i>perimysium</i>, and sends fine prolongations in
between the fibres, termed <i>endomysium</i>. The intervals seen on high
amplification between the dark stri&aelig; are called Kruse’s membrane.
On breaking up the striated structure it is resolvable into fibrill&aelig;
and furthermore into discs.

<p>1. Vertical section of epidermis; 2. Pigment cells from a lower layer of cutis.</p></div>

<p>Among mammalia the pig furnishes the best examples of muscle
fibrill&aelig;; among insects the water-beetle and the thorax of the housefly.
A power of 600 or 800 diameters is required to separate the
fibrill&aelig;. Blood-vessels are well supplied with striated muscle, but
none of their minuter branches penetrate the sarcolemma. The
involuntary or non-striated variety of muscular fibre exists in all
parts of the body where movements occur independently of the will,
also in the ciliary muscle and the iris of the eye, as well as in the
middle coats of the arteries. Non-striated fibres are pale in colour,
prismatic in shape, and easily flattened by pressure. In size, they
vary from <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>7000</sub>th to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3500</sub>th of an inch in diameter, and are marked
at short intervals by oblong corpuscles.</p>

<p><i>The Integument or Skin</i> consists of epidermis or cuticle, dermis,
corium or cutis vera, sweat-glands, nails, hairs, sebaceous glands,
and numerous nerves and vessels. The epidermis forms a
protective covering over the whole surface of the body, and is
moulded on to the surface of the corium beneath, covering the ridges,
depressions and papill&aelig;. It is made up of three principal layers:
the horny layer or <i>stratium corneum</i>, the most superficial, this
consists of layers of flattened cells, which are without a nucleus; the
<i>stratum lucidum</i>, composed of layers of nucleated cells, more or less
indistinct in section; the <i>rete mucosum</i> or malpighian layer; is composed
in its upper part of layers of “prickle cells” and its inferior of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_647">647</span>
a single stratum of columnar cells. Pigment is principally found in
the lowest layer, <a href="#fig_429">Fig. 429</a>.</p>

<p>The gradations of colour in the skin are due to the granular
contents of the pigment cells. This is seen on steeping sections
cut from the skin of a negro in chlorine; the colour is discharged.
In <a href="#pl_xix">Plate XIX</a>., No. 13, the pigment cells of the choroid coat of eye
are shown. Here the pigment is darker in colour, and its function
is the absorption of light and the prevention of disturbing effects
occasioned by circles of dispersion.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 430.&mdash;Vertical section of skin and subcutaneous tissues, showing the
sweat-glands and fat-globules, ducts passing upwards to the epidermis or
external cuticle. Magnified 250 diameters.</p></div>

<p><i>The Dermis</i>, or true skin, consists of an interlacing network of
connective tissue, yellow elastic tissue corpuscles, vessels, and nerves.
There are also small muscular fibres in connection with the hair
follicles, and beneath the subcutaneous tissues contain an abundant
supply of fat adipose tissue. Numerous ridges are seen on the
surface, especially on the palm of the hand and sole of the foot,
caused by rows of little elevations of the cutis vera, termed papill&aelig;.
These are more or less conical, and contain a capillary loop, nerve,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_648">648</span>
and touch corpuscle, which serve to increase the sensitiveness of the
part, lodging a touch corpuscle in a favourable position for receiving
sensations of touch, <a href="#fig_430">Fig. 430</a>.</p>

<p>Sweat glands are situated in the subcutaneous tissue, and consist
of fine tubes, which form the duct (seen in the section, <a href="#fig_430">Fig. 430</a>);
these are continuous with a blind extremity, coiled up into a ball one-sixtieth
of an inch in diameter, and surrounded by a plexus of
capillaries to form the gland (<a href="#fig_431">Fig. 431</a>, No. 2). Between the layer of
columnar cells and the limiting membrane is a layer of non-striated
muscle, and beneath the rite mucosum there are several layers of
polyhedral cells, and an external and internal limiting membrane;
the epithelium of the duct is at its mouth continuous with the
epithelium of the epidermis.</p>

the scalp, with two hair-sacs; <i>a.</i> epidermis; <i>b.</i> cutis; <i>c.</i> muscles of the hair
follicles.</p></div>

<p><i>Nails</i> consist of a root and body, the lunular of which is the
whitish portion of the body near the root, where the skin beneath
is less vascular than any other portion of the finger. The nail
closely resembles the epidermis, and consists of hard and thin layers
of cells on the surface, and round, moist cells beneath. Posteriorly
the nail fits into a groove which lodges its root. The part to which
the nail is attached is known as the nail-bed. The stratified
appearance produced by the coalescence of the cells, and their lying
over each other, is shown in <a href="#pl_vii">Plate VII</a>., No. 149, the toe of the
mouse; while the special arrangement of tissue is better seen under
polarised light (<a href="#pl_viii">Plate VIII</a>., No. 174).</p>

<p><i>Hairs</i> consist of a shaft and root. The shaft is cylindrical, and
covered with a layer of imbricated scales, arranged with their edges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_649">649</span>
upwards. The substance of the hair consists of fibres, or elongated
fusiform cells, in which nuclei are seen. There are present in some
hairs (<a href="#fig_432">Fig. 432</a>) small air spaces or lacun&aelig;. In the coarser hair
of the body there is a pith (medulla), occupied by small angular
cells and fat granules.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>1. Single Hair-root and Shaft; 2. Vertical section, showing fibrous character
of the hair together with colouring matter, external edges serrated; 3. Transverse
section of human hair, medullary substance, and central pith.</p></div>

<p>The root of the hair is seen to dilate that it may fit more firmly
into the skin hair-follicle. The latter consists of two coats, an outer
and an inner, continuous with the epidermis, and this is called the
root sheath. The outer portion consists of three layers, formed of
connective tissue, blood-vessels, and nerves. The inner, or epidermic,
coat comes away when the hair is pulled out, and hence is called the
root sheath. This again is made up of two layers, the outer of
which corresponds with the horny layer, and is composed of flattened
cells. The bulbous root of the hair is connected with the papilla.
In the cat the tactile nasal hairs are very large. Small bundles of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_650">650</span>
involuntary muscular fibres connect the corium with the root, so
that in contracting they elevate or expand the hair.</p>

scales; 3. Hair of mouse, showing pigment layers; 4. Hair of a small beetle
(Dermestes). &times; 250.</p></div>

<p>The hair of the lower animals presents a diversity of structure,
especially on the outer surface, and with reference to the arrangement
of the scales. The hair of the Indian bat, for instance, consists of
a shaft invested with erectile scales, placed at regular intervals;
these stand out from the shaft, as in <a href="#fig_433">Fig. 433</a>, No. 1. This form
of scale varies considerably in the different species of these animals,
and a portion of hair near the root is nearly divested of scales.
Many of the scales are not unlike those of certain of the insect
tribe, seen in that of Dermestes, No. 3, while the hair of the mouse
has a series of transverse imbricated scales arranged as tiles on
a house, due to accumulated pigment. Hairs taken from various
animals form interesting objects of study for the microscope, as
already noticed. Other hairs are shown in <a href="#fig_434">Fig. 434</a>. No. 1 is a transverse
section of a hair from the ant-eater; the central part consists of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_651">651</span>
air-cells, the outer of a granular pith. No. 2 is a transverse section
of hair of peccary, with a diversified arrangement of the cortical
envelope, sending outward a set of radial prolongations and air-cells;
this kind of structure is also found in the
quills of the porcupine. No. 3 is a transverse
section of a hair of the elephant, which
shows a combination of a number of tubes
united together, somewhat resembling the
arrangement of the hoof-horn of some of the
ruminants, and the denser horny growth on
the snout of the rhinoceros, No. 4. The
curious modification of these horny structures
is seen in the horns of other animals,
and which may be likened to a bundle of
hairs. On making a transverse section, as
in <a href="#fig_434">Fig. 434</a>, and submitting it to polarised
light, on rotating the analyser, the dark
central spot shown is replaced by a bright
one with a play of colours due to the interference of light (Plate
VIII., No. 178). The scales of fish are also of interest (Fig.
435). These have been shown to afford an unerring guide in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_652">652</span>
classification of fishes and in the examination of their fossil remains.
As a class of objects for the microscope, they are found to be both
curious and beautiful. <a href="#pl_viii">Plate VIII</a>., No. 176, is a scale of the
grayling, seen under polarised light.</p>

<p>Of the harder outgrowths of the dermal structures, the teeth
afford the chief example among animals. The rough anatomy of
the tooth in mankind consists of a crown, that projects from the
gum; a root, or fangs, fixed in a socket of the jawbone, and a short
intermediary neck. Each tooth is supplied with an artery and nerve,
and has a central cavity filled with a soft, vascular, sensitive substance,
the pulp. On making a vertical section of a tooth, we
recognise the several structures in the order of, pulp, crusta, petrosa,
dentine, and enamel. A section through a human molar tooth
(shown in <a href="#fig_436">Fig. 436</a>) will convey some idea of the arrangement of the
denser structures referred to above.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Fig. 436.&mdash;Sections of Human Molar Tooth (magnified 50 diameters).
1. Vertical section; 2. Horizontal section.</p></div>

<p>Blandin was the first to demonstrate that teeth are developed in
the mucous membrane, similar to that of hair and nails. Teeth are
formed in grooves of the mucous membrane, and subsequently
converted into closed sacs by a process of involution, and their
final adhesion to the jaw is a later process. It is very generally
conceded that teeth belong to the <i>muco-dermoid</i>, and not to the
periosteal, series of tissues; that, instead of standing in close relation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_653">653</span>
to the endo-skeleton, they are part of the dermal or exo-skeleton;
their true analogues being the hair, and some other epidermic
appendages. Huxley proved that, although teeth are developed in two
ways, they are mere varieties of the usual mode in the animal kingdom.
In the first, which is typified by the mackerel and the frog, the
pulp is never free, but from the first is inclosed within the capsule,
seeming to sink down as fast as it grows. In the other, the pulp
projects freely at one period above the surface of the mucous
membrane, becoming subsequently included within a capsule formed
by the involution of the latter; this occurs in the human subject.
The skate offers a sort of intermediate structure.</p>

<p>The <i>enamel</i> forms a continuous layer, and invests the crown of the
tooth; it is thickest upon the masticating surface, and decreases
towards the neck, where it usually terminates. The external surface
of the enamel appears smooth, but is always marked by delicate

(Nasmyth’s membrane), containing calcareous matter. This membrane
is separable after being subjected to hydrochloric acid; it then
appears like a network of areolar tissue, shown in <a href="#fig_438">Fig. 438</a>, No. 6;
Huxley’s “<i>calcified membrana</i>,” which commence at the pulp cavity,
and pass up to the enamel.</p>

<p>Czermak discovered that the curious appearances of globular
conglomerate formations in the substance of dentine depend on its
mode of <i>calcification</i> and the presence of earthy material; and he
attributed the contour lines to the same cause. Contour markings
vary in intensity and number; they are most abundant in the root,
and most marked in the crown. Vertical sections exhibit them the
best; as <a href="#fig_440">Fig. 440</a>, No. 1. In preparing a specimen, first make the
section accurately, then decalcify it by submersion in dilute hydrochloric
acid; dry it and mount in Canada balsam; place the specimen
in the hot chamber for some time to soak in the fluid resin before
it cools. The white opacity at the extremity of the contour
markings gives the appearance of rings to the tooth-fang.</p>

<p>“The tooth-substance appears,” says Czermak, “on its inner
surface, not as a symmetrical whole, but consisting of balls of various
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_655">655</span>
diameter, which are fused together into a mass with one another in
different degrees, and in which the dentine tubes in contact with
the germ cavity terminate. By reflected light, <i>dark-ground</i> illumination,
one perceives this stalactite-like condition of the inner surface
of the tooth-substance very distinctly, by means of the varied
illumination of the globular elevations, and by the shadows which
they cast.” To see this structure to advantage the preparation
should be made from a tooth root, the growth of which is not
complete. With such preparations, the ground-substance of the last
formed layer of the tooth-substance is seen to be, at least partly, in
the form of globular masses, fused together
with those of the penultimate layers.</p>

<p>The cementum is the cortical layer of
osseous tissue, forming an outer coating to
the fangs, which it sometimes cements
together. Its internal surface is intimately
united with the <i>dentine</i>, and in many teeth
it would appear as if the earliest determined
arrangement of the fibres of the dentine
started from the <i>canaliculi</i>, as they radiate
from the lacun&aelig; in the cement. The inter-lacunar
layer is often striated, and exhibits
a laminated structure: sometimes it appears as if Haversian canals
were running in a perpendicular direction to the pulp cavity. The
<i>canaliculi</i> frequently run out into numerous branches, connecting
one with another, and anastomising with the ends of the dentine
fibres. The thick layers of cement which occur in old teeth show
immense quantities of aggregated lacun&aelig; of an irregular and elongated
form.</p>

<p><i>Compact Tissues, Cartilage and Bone.</i>&mdash;Cartilage is a bluish or
yellowish-white, semi-transparent, elastic substance, without vessels or
nerves, and surrounded by a membrane, termed pericondrium, of a
dense fibrous nature. That kind, however, known as articular cartilage,
receives a layer of epithelium from the synovial membrane,
but this is confined to marginal portions, in consequence of the
central wear which occurs as soon as the parts are subjected to
friction, during the movement of the limbs. Cartilage covers the
ends of all bones in apposition to form joints, and thus lessens
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_656">656</span>
the effects of concussion. Besides the ordinary kind of cartilage,
temporary and permanent, there are two modifications of the tissue,
confined to certain portions of the body: cellular cartilage, composed
of cells lying close together, in a mesh formed of fine fibres;
and fibro-cartilage, cells distributed in a matrix of fibrous tissue.</p>

<p>Examined with a low power, cartilage appears to be homogeneous
in structure, studded over with numerous round, oval, oblong,
semilunar, and irregular-shaped corpuscles, as seen in <a href="#pl_xix">Plate XIX</a>.,
No. 8, a vertical section of animal cartilage, arranged in columns,
and condensed at the lower surface previous to its conversion
into bone. The greater opacity of this portion is owing to the
increase of osseous fibres, and the multiplication of oil globules,
and the intercellular spaces becoming filled with vessels. No. 9
shows a small transverse section of the same, with a further change of
the cartilage cells at <i>a</i> into bone cells, and at <i>b</i> with the characteristic
canaliculi and lacun&aelig;. No. 7 further shows a section of the large
tendon fixed to the back of the heel of the foot, near the juncture of
the tendo-Archillis with the cartilage. For the examination of these
several changes a high power is necessary, and for the purpose pieces
taken from the ox may be easily obtained from the butcher, and fine
sections cut with a razor parallel to the surface.</p>

<p>1. Cartilage from a mouse’s ear closely resembling vegetable tissue &times;200;
2. Cartilage from rabbit’s ear, with nucleated cells embedded in matrix;
3. Cartilage from the end of a human rib &times;300.</p></div>

<p>The better specimens for microscopical examination are those
taken from very young animals, in whom the ossific process is still
incomplete. In order to examine cellular cartilage, the ear of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_657">657</span>
mouse should be taken and just dried sufficiently to enable fine
sections to be cut by the microtome transversely (<a href="#fig_440">Fig. 440</a>).</p>

<p>Cartilage forms the entire skeleton of a certain number of fishes,
as the skate, lamprey, ray, shark, &amp;c., the cells of which are
embedded in a matrix of granular matter, which has been properly
termed intercellular. The nearest approach to ossification of cartilage
in fishes is that of the cuttle-fish; in this stellate cells are
freely distributed, as shown in <a href="#fig_441">Fig. 441</a>, No. 3.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>White fibro-cartilage occurs between the bodies of the vertebr&aelig;
as a connecting medium. In this kind the cells are more widely
distributed, specimens of which may be taken from the central
portion of an interarticular disc of any animal. The oval or
circular corpuscles will be seen surrounded by an abundance of
fibrous tissue.</p>

<p>An acquaintance with the degeneration of the textures with
which we have been dealing may be of service to the student, as he
may, in the course of his examination, meet with an abnormal
condition altogether different to those described. The process of
degeneration is usually a slow one, except in the case of fatty infiltration,
an example of which is furnished by the fatty degeneration
of the liver in Strasburg geese. Muscular tissue is very prone to
fatty degeneration, and fatty heart is often met with. Calcareous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_658">658</span>
degeneration of the muscles, ligaments, and cartilages, as well as
morbid deposits, are not at all uncommon in these structures. In
<a href="#pl_xix">Plate XIX</a>., No. 9, a small section is given of an enchondroma,
and in which the round or ovoid cells of the cartilage are seen
degenerated and converted into granular masses of a calcareous
nature. <a href="#fig_442">Fig. 442</a> is a somewhat more highly magnified section
of a calcareous or morbid growth, taken from a human subject in
which a morbid growth was
seen to be gradually destroying
the bone and cartilage cells.</p>

<p class="hang">Fig. 442.&mdash;Cartilage taken from a diseased
finger, in which both cartilage and bone
were in a state of degeneration.</p></div>

<p><i>Bone.</i>&mdash;Bone is a hard unyielding
structure, and which
in the vertebrata forms the
skeleton of the adult. It is
the framework for the support
of the soft tissues of the body,
and forms various cavities for
the reception of important
organs, as the brain, spinal
cord, eyes, heart and lungs,
and acts as levers for the action
of the muscles and joints. The
partial elasticity of bone is
seen in the ribs, and the rebound
when the skull is dropped on
the ground. Bone consists of
earthy and animal matters
intimately combined; the removal
of either, however, does not destroy the form of the bone,
if the process of separation be carefully conducted. The earthy
constituents may all be dissolved out by hydrochloric acid, but
the form of the bone is preserved in its minute particular, and
in this state sections may be cut for microscopical examination.
If allowed to become dry it shrivels, and assumes the density of
horn. The interior of a bone is of a spongy or cancellated structure,
particularly at the ends. The outer portion of the bone is
more dense than the internal part. The study of bone should
commence with sections of the softened structure. Directions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_659">659</span>
for making sections of bone are given in the chapter on Practical
Microscopy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption">PLATE XX</p>
<img id="pl_xx" src="images/pl_xx.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="caption">VERTEBRATA, BONE STRUCTURE.</p></div>

<p>The intimate structure of bone will be studied in connection with
<a href="#pl_xx">Plate XX</a>. Two series of lamell&aelig; may be demonstrated in bone
after maceration in acid, a larger system surrounding the medullary
canal, and a smaller surrounding the Haversian canals, both of which
are seen in Nos. 1 and 2. In macerating bones, the lamell&aelig; of the
layer concentric system may be peeled off in layers; these are seen
to be pierced with fine apertures, caused by the canaliculi. In
some parts larger apertures are seen through which bundles of fibres
pass, pinning, as it were, the several layers together; these are the
perforating fibres. The outermost of the layers, being near the
periosteum, the membrane covering the bone, are termed periosteal
layers; the innermost, being close to the canal, are called medullary
layers. No. 1 is a transverse section of a flat bone, the clavicle,
and it shows the Haversian canals, varying in size from <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2000</sub>th to
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>200</sub>th of an inch in diameter, the largest being near the medullary
canal. In shape they are round, oval, or oblong, according to the
line of section. Each canal is surrounded by rings, none of which are
complete, and running one into the other at various parts. Under
a higher power, those irregular shaped bodies termed lacun&aelig;, with
fine radiating fibres, are seen to be smaller canals, canaliculi.</p>

<p>By means of this complete and intricate distribution of the
canals of the Haversian system, the nutritive fluids pass into the
most compact parts of the osseous tissue. Longitudinal sections
of the long bones show these canals as continuous branching-out
cells.</p>

<p>In many of the lower animals the bony structure differs from
those of man, as will be seen in <a href="#pl_xx">Plate XX</a>. No. 3 shows a transverse
section of the femur, or leg-bone of an ostrich, magnified
ninety-five times, in which the Haversian canals are much smaller
and more numerous, and many of them run in the transverse
direction. No. 4, again, is a transverse section of the humerus,
or fore-arm bone of a turtle (<i>Chelonia mydas</i>). This exhibits traces
of Haversian canals, with a slight tendency to a concentric arrangement
of bone-cells around them, the bone-cells being large and
numerous, and occur, for the most part, in parallel rows. In No. 5,
a horizontal section of the lower jaw-bone of a conger-eel exhibits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_660">660</span>
a single plane of bone-cells arranged in parallel lines. There are
no Haversian canals present, and when this specimen is contrasted
with that of No. 4, it will be noticed that the canaliculi given off
from each of the bone-cells of this fish are very few in number
in comparison with that of the reptile. No. 6 is a section of a
portion of the cranium of a siren (<i>Siren lacertina</i>), remarkable for
the large size of the bone-cells, and of the canaliculi, which are
larger in this animal than in any other yet examined; and as in the
preceding specimen, no Haversian canals are present. No. 7 is a
section of bone taken from the exterior of the shaft of the humerus
of a Pterodactyle; this exhibits the elongated bone-cells characteristic
of the order Reptilia. No. 8 is a horizontal section of a
scale, or flattened spine, from the skin of a Trygon, or sting ray;
this exhibits large Haversian canals, with numerous wavy parallel
tubes, like those of dentine, communicating with them. This
specimen shows, besides wavy tubes, numerous bone-cells, whose
canaliculi communicate with the tubes, as in dentine.</p>

<p>The following points may be noted with regard to the several
sections of bone described. That of the bird, for instance, contrasted
with that of the mammal, exhibits the following peculiarities:
the Haversian canals are more abundant, much smaller, and often
run in a direction at right angles to that of the shaft, by which
means the concentric laminated arrangement is in some cases lost;
the direction of the canals follows the curve of the bone; the bone-cells
are much smaller and more numerous; while the number
of canaliculi sent off from the cells is less than in those of mammals.
No. 3 is the average length of a bone-cell of the ostrich, <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2000</sub>th
of an inch, in breadth <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6000</sub>th.</p>

<p>In the Reptilia, the bones may be either hollow, cancellated,
or solid; and their specific gravity is less than that of birds or
mammals. The short bones of most of the chelonian reptiles are
solid, and the long bones are either hollow or cancellated; the ribs
of the serpent-tribe are hollow, the medullary cavity performing
the office of a Haversian canal; the bone-cells are accordingly
arranged in concentric circles around their canals. The vertebr&aelig;
of these animals are solid; and the bone, like that of certain
birds, is remarkable for density and whiteness. When a transverse
section is taken from one of the long bones, and contrasted with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_661">661</span>
that of a mammal or bird, the difference will be noticed; there
are very few, if any, Haversian canals, and these are large; and
at one view, in the section, No. 7, the canals and bone-cells are
arranged both vertically and longitudinally. The bone-cells are
remarkable for the great size to which they attain; in the turtle
they are <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>375</sub>th of an inch in length, the canaliculi are extremely
numerous, and are of a size proportionate to that of the bone-cell.</p>

<p>In fishes a greater variation occurs in the minute structure of
the skeleton than in either of the three preceding classes. A rare
structure is that of the sword of the sword-fish (Istiophorus). In
this, Haversian canals and a concentric laminated arrangement of
the bone are found, but no bone-cells. The Haversian canals, when
they are present, are of large size, and very numerous, and then
the bone-cells are, generally speaking, either absent or but few in
number, their place being occupied by tubes or canaliculi, which
are often of a very large size. The bone-cells are remarkable for
their graduate figure, and the canaliculi derived from them are
comparatively few in number. In a thin section of the scale of an
osseous fish, the cells lie nearly all in one plane, and the anastomoses
of the canaliculi are more distinctly seen; in the hard scales of many,
as the Lepidosteus and Calicthys, and in spines of the Silurid&aelig;, the
bone-cells are well differentiated. In the true bony scales comprising
the exo-skeleton of cartilaginous fishes the bone-cells are seen in great
numbers.</p>

<p>Now, if we proceed at once to the application of the facts which
have been laid down, and make a fragment of bone of an extinct
animal the subject of investigation, it will be found that the
bone-cells in Mammalia are tolerably uniform in size; and if we
take <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2000</sub>th of an inch as a standard, the bone-cells of birds fall
below that standard; but the bone-cells of reptiles are much above
either of the two preceding, while those of fishes are essentially
different, both in size and shape, and are not likely to be mistaken
for one or the other; so that the determination of a minute yet
characteristic fragment of fishes’ bone is a task easily performed.
If the portion of bone does not exhibit bone-cells, but presents either
one or other of the characters indicated, the task of discrimination
is equally easy. We have now the mammal, the bird, and
the reptile to deal with. In consequence of the very great size
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_662">662</span>
of the cells and their canaliculi in the reptile, a portion of bone
of one of these animals can readily be distinguished from that of
a bird, or a mammal. The only difficulty lies between these two
last; but, notwithstanding that on a cursory glance the bone of
a bird appears very like that of a mammal, there are certain points
in their minute structure in which they differ; and one is the difference
in size of the bone-cells. To determine accurately, therefore,
between the two, we must, if the section be a transverse one, also
note the comparative sizes of the Haversian canals, and the tortuosity
of their course; for the diameter of the canal bears a certain proportion
to the size of the bone-cells, and after close examination the
eye will readily detect differences.</p>

nucleated epithelium cells appear.</p></div>

<p><i>Arteries and Veins.</i>&mdash;The circulation of the animal frame is maintained
by arteries, veins, and capillaries. The arteries are elastic
and contractile tubes; these convey the blood from the heart to the
capillaries. The larger arteries are exceedingly elastic, but feebly
contractile on account of the muscular tissue in their walls. The
veins ramify throughout the body, are more numerous than the
arteries, and of greater capacity. They usually accompany the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_663">663</span>
arteries and correspond to them in structure, the larger veins
possessing semi-lunar valves; these project into their interiors, and
thus prevent the regurgitation of the blood. They have four coats,
consisting of areolar tissue, yellow fibres combined with muscular
fibres, and white fibrous tissue, two layers of yellow fibres arranged
longitudinally, and a single layer of epithelial cells. Intermediate
between the arteries and veins there are exceedingly fine tubes,
termed capillaries, in which the arteries terminate, and from which
the veins arise. These are composed of a fine homogeneous membrane,
with here and there a nucleus. The capillary circulation of
the blood is readily seen in the tail
of the newt and the foot of the frog,
<a href="#fig_443">Fig. 443</a>.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_444" src="images/fig_444.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 444.&mdash;A network of
capillaries.</p></div>

<p>A network of capillaries conveying
blood to the lungs, and ramifying
throughout the structure, is shown in
<a href="#fig_444">Fig. 444</a>, and in <a href="#pl_xix">Plate XIX</a>., No. 6, the
termination of a capillary of a blood-vessel
in the fat-cells of the human
body. <a href="#pl_vii">Plate VII</a>. illustrates the distribution
of the arteries and veins to various
parts of the animal body. This coloured
plate, however, is designed to show the
value of injected preparations in the
delineation of animal structures. By
thus artificially restoring the blood and distending the tissues, a
much better idea is obtained of the relative condition of parts, the
appearance presented by the erectile papill&aelig;, &amp;c. In the section
of foot of mouse (No. 149), the bone is seen surrounded by its
vascular supply, arterial and venous; in No. 150, the papill&aelig; of
the tongue are distended and seen erect; in No. 152, a vertical
section of the fungi-form papill&aelig; on the tongue of cat, with
capillary loops passing into them, is demonstrated; in No. 151, the
vertical section of brain of a rat, the vascular supply is shown;
No. 153, the malpighian tufts (circular bodies) and arteries ramifying
about the structure; in No. 154, the vertical section through
the intestine of the rat, shows villi (arteries and veins) surmounted
by epithelium, and supported on a layer of the mucous membrane;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_664">664</span>
in No. 155, the vascular supply sent to the roots of the whisker of
the nose of the mouse; in No. 157, a tangential section cut through
the several textures, the sclerotic coat and retina of the eye of
a cat is clearly made out although not highly magnified; again,
in No. 156, the beautiful vascular arrangement of the internal
gill of the tadpole could scarcely be so strikingly illustrated in
any other way; while in the central, No. 158, the vascular system
throughout the whole of the body of a fully developed tadpole, with
the way in which the blood is carried from the remotest part of the
tail to the heart, and sent to the gills, the brain, &amp;c., it is quite
unnecessary to enlarge upon. These are seen under a low power,
but for the purpose of studying the basement membrane, together
with the intimate association and termination of the nerves accompanying
the arteries and veins, it is absolutely necessary to resort
to a staining process, and cutting fine sections with the microtome.
Small portions of a nerve may be cut off with fine scissors, teased
out with needles, and a drop of acetic acid added to render the
sheath more transparent; in a few seconds the connective tissue
corpuscles will be brought into view. For the microscopical examination
of nerve-fibrill&aelig; take a small section from the leg of a frog,
and tease it out in blood serum or white of egg. In size the fibrill&aelig;
vary, even in the same nerve, from the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12000</sub>th to the <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>1500</sub>th of an
inch in diameter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_445" src="images/fig_445.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 445.</p></div>

<p>To show the circulation of the blood in the frog’s foot, and without
causing the animal pain or much inconvenience, it is better to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_665">665</span>
enclose it in a black silk bag, and draw out the foot as shown at <i>a a a</i>,
<a href="#fig_445">Fig. 445</a>. The bag provided should be from three to four inches in
length, and two and a half inches broad, shown at <i>b b</i>, having a piece
of tape, <i>c c</i>, sewn to each side, about midway between the mouth
and the bottom, and the mouth itself capable of being closed by a
drawing-in string, <i>d d</i>. Into this bag the frog is placed, and only
the leg which is about to be examined kept outside; the string <i>d d</i>
must then be drawn sufficiently tight around the small part of the
leg to prevent the foot from being pulled into the bag, but not to
stop the circulation; three short pieces of thread, <i>f f f</i>, are now
passed around the three principal toes; and the bag with the frog
must be fastened to the plate <i>a a</i> by means of the tapes <i>c c</i>. When
this is accomplished, the threads <i>f f f</i> are passed either through some
of the holes in the edge of the plate, three of which are shown at
<i>g g g</i>, in order to keep the web open; or, what answers better, in a
series of pegs of the shape represented by <i>h</i>, each having a slit, <i>i</i>,
extending more than halfway down it; the threads are wound
round these two or three times, and then the end is secured by
putting it into the slit <i>i</i>. The plate is now ready to be adapted to
the stage of the microscope: the square opening over which the foot
is secured must be brought over the aperture in the stage through
which the light passes from the mirror.</p>

<p>The tadpole circulation is readily seen by placing the creature on
its back, when we immediately observe the beating heart, a bulbous-looking
cavity, formed of delicate, transparent tissue, through which
the blood alternately enters by one orifice and leaves by a more
distant exit. The heart, it will be noticed, is enclosed within its
pericardium, this being the more delicate part of the creature’s
organisation. The binocular microscope should be used for viewing
the circulation. Passing along the course of the great blood-vessels
to the right and left of the heart, the eye is arrested by a large oval
body, of a more complicated structure. This is the inner gill, formed
of delicate, transparent tissue, traversed by arteries, and a network of
blood-vessels. It is almost unnecessary to say the tadpole has a
respiratory and circulatory system resembling those of fishes.</p>

<p>In nearly all fish the heart has but two cavities, an auricle and
ventricle; the blood is returned by the veins to the auricle, passes
into the ventricle, and is then transmitted to the gills, where, being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_666">666</span>
exposed to the air contained in the water, it becomes deprived of
carbonic acid, aerated, and rendered fit to breathe. In the reptile
we find a modification of plan. The heart has three cavities, two
auricles and one ventricle; by this contrivance there is a perpetual
mixture in the heart of the impure carbonized blood which has
already circulated through the body, and flows into the ventricle
from the <i>right</i> auricle, with the purer aerated blood returned from
the lungs, which flows at the same instant into the ventricle from the
<i>left</i> auricle.</p>

<p>For the purpose of subsequent observations the tadpole should be
selected at a period in which the skin is perfectly transparent, otherwise
the appearances already described of the form and situation of the
heart, and the three great arterial trunks (proceeding right and left),
will not be clearly made out. The anatomical arrangement of the
vessels will be seen to be closely connected with the corresponding
gill, the upper one (the <i>cephalic</i>) running along the upper edge of
the gill, giving off, in its course, a branch which ascends to the
mouth, with its accompanying vein; this is termed the <i>labial</i> artery
and vein. The cephalic artery continues its course around the gill,
until it suddenly curves upwards and backwards, and reaches the
upper surface of the head, when it dips down between the eye and
the brain.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that this can be made out in the average
tadpole, the obstacle to which is the large coil of intestines, usually
distended with dark-coloured food. This must first be reduced by
making your tadpole live on plain water for some days. <a href="#pl_vii">Plate VII</a>.,
No. 158, affords a view of the vessels obtained under the influence
of low diet, and whereby we are enabled to trace the course of the
three large arteries. The third trunk, traversing the lung, is seen to
emerge from the lower edge and descend into the abdomen to form
the great abdominal aorta. A small half-starved tadpole shows
the heart beating and the blood circulating, but the latter is quite
colourless, not a single red globule visible anywhere. The heart is a
colourless globe, the gills two transparent ovals, and the intestines a
colourless, transparent coil. Through the empty coil the artery is
seen on either side leaving the gills, and converging towards the
spine, and uniting to form the abdominal aorta, the large central
vessel coloured red in the figure. After the aorta has supplied the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_667">667</span>
abdominal viscera, a prolongation, or <i>caudal</i> artery is seen descending
to the tail, the all-important organ of locomotion in the tadpole.
This artery, entering the root of the tail, is imbedded deeply in the
flesh, whence it emerges, and then continues its course, closely
accompanied by the vein, to within a short distance of the extremity,
where, being reduced to a state of extreme fineness, it terminates
in a capillary loop, composed of the end of the artery and the beginning
of the vein. The artery, in its course, gives off branches
continually to supply the neighbouring tissue. The blood-current
in the tail is often seen, even in the main artery or vein, to be
sluggish. This occurs independently of the heart, which will continue
to beat as usual; it happens, because the circulation in the
tail depends very much on the motion of the organ. When this is
suspended (as in the confined tadpole under the microscope), the
blood moves sluggishly, or stops, till the tail regains its freedom and
motion, when the activity of the current is restored.</p>

<p>Having traced the arterial system which conveys the blood from
the heart to the extremities, we will now note its return by the veins
back again to the heart.</p>

<p>The caudal vein runs near the artery during the greater part of
its course, with its stream of blood <i>towards</i> the heart. This stream
is swollen by perpetual tributaries from numerous vessels. As the
vein approaches the root of the tail it is inclined towards the artery,
and diverges from it at the point of entering the abdomen. Here it
approaches the kidneys and sends off branches, while the main trunk
continues its course onward; and, passing upwards behind a coil of
intestine, it approaches the liver, and runs in a curved course along
the margin of that organ. The blood is now seen to enter the vena
cava by several channels, that converge towards the great vein as it
passes in close proximity to the organ. Beyond the liver the vena
cava continues its course upwards and inwards to its termination in
the sinus venosus or rudimentary auricle of the heart. This termination
is the junction of not less than six distinct venous trunks,
incessantly pouring their blood into the heart. The circulation in
the fringed lips forms a most complicated network of vessels, out of
which proceeds a vein corresponding to the artery already traced.
This descends in a direct course till it joins the principal vein of the
head, which corresponds to the <i>jugular</i> in the mammalia.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_668">668</span></p>

<p>Thus it will be seen the blood is driven by the heart into each
inner gill through three large blood-vessels, which arise directly from
the <i>truncus arteriosus</i>, and may be called the <i>afferent vessels of the
gill</i>. In <a href="#pl_vii">Plate VII</a>., No. 156, an enlarged view of a gill is shown.</p>

<p>On closer examination “each <i>internal gill</i> or entire branchial organ
is seen to consist of cartilaginous arches, with a piece of additional
framework of a triangular form, stretching beyond the arches, composed
of semi-transparent, gelatinous-looking material. These form
the framework of the organ and support upon their upper surface the
three rows of crests with their vascular network, and the main
arterial and venous trunks lying parallel to and between them. The
three systemic arteries arising, right and left, from the <i>truncus
arteriosus</i>, enter each gill on its cardiac side, and then follow the
course of the crests, lying in close proximity to them. The upper of
these branchial arteries runs alone on the outside of the upper crest,
and another branch leaving the trunk and passing into the network
of the crest, whence a returning vessel may be traced carrying back
the blood <i>across</i> the branchial artery, and to a vessel lying close to
and taking the same course as the artery itself. Carrying the eye
along the latter vessel we find, at a short distance from the first of
these crest branches, a second, leaving the main trunk and entering
the crest, when a corresponding returning vessel conveys the blood
across the arterial trunk into the vessel lying beside it, as in the
former instance. A number of these branches may be traced from
one crest to the other. But it is now seen that the trunk from
which these arterial branches spring diminishes in size as it proceeds
in its course (like the gill artery in fishes), while the vessel running
parallel to it and receiving the stream as it returns from the crest
enlarges to some extent. Thus, the artery or <i>afferent</i> vessel which
brings the blood to the gill is large at its entrance, but gradually
diminishes and dwindles to a point at the opposite end of the crest;
while the venous or <i>efferent</i> vessel, beginning as a mere radical,
gradually enlarges, and thus becomes the trunk that conveys the
blood out of the gill to its ultimate destination. This vessel is the
<i>upper branchial vein</i> so long as it remains in contact with the gill;
subsequently it changes its name on leaving the gill and as it passes
upwards for distribution to the head, when it is designated the
<i>cephalic artery</i>. The <i>middle branchial artery and vein</i> proceed in like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_669">669</span>
manner in connection with the middle crest, and the <i>lower artery and
vein</i> in connection with the lower crest. The middle and lower venous
trunks, having reached the extremity of the crests, curve downwards
and inwards, and leave the gill. The former trunk, converging towards
the spine, meets its fellow, and with it forms the <i>ventral aorta</i>. The
latter gives origin to the <i>pulmonary artery</i>, and supplies also the
integuments of the neck. Curious and interesting is the final stage of
the metamorphosis, when the waning tadpole and incipient frog coexist,
and are actually seen together in the same subject. The dwindling
gills and the shrinking tail&mdash;the last remnants of the tadpole form&mdash;are
yet seen, in company with the coloured, spotted skin, the newly
formed and slender legs, the flat head, the wide and toothless mouth,
and the crouching attitude of the all but perfect reptile.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>To observe the circulation and how it is carried on during life in
the gills, the outer covering must be carefully raised, or even stripped
off. This will be better accomplished by putting the tadpole under
the influence of cocaine or chloroform&mdash;a drop of the fluid is sufficient
for the purpose.</p>

<p>The metamorphosis in the embryo of the frog is by no means
exceptional. The ascidian begins life in the form of a tadpole, with
a muscular tail; subsequently it fixes itself by its head to a rock,
and its tail disappears. The changes the tadpole of the frog passes
through are in every respect, except in one or two minor details,
similar to those of adult amphibia which pass their whole lives in water.
The newly-hatched flat-fish is symmetrical, an eye being placed on
each side of its head, with the adults of other fishes. The fœtal
whale has well-developed hind limbs, and which, after passing into a
condition almost perfect in proportion to the rest of the body, gradually
dwindle away again to the merest rudimentary structures. In
all these, and a number of similar cases, it is seen that the earlier
condition of existing animals represents, and is in agreement with
that of its adult ancestor of a remote period in the past. Collected
facts bearing upon this question have been made the groundwork
of a theory of hereditary properties in the germ, and a disposition to
go through the same phases of life as the parent.

<h3>The Mineral and Geological Kingdoms.</h3>

<p>The structure of rocks and the formation of crystals will be found
to furnish an endless supply of instructive material for the microscope.
In sciences of pure observation, as those of mineralogy and
geology, the facts to be observed are of several different kinds, and
where so many observers are at work all over the world, constant
progress will necessarily be made, as well as continued correction
required from change and improvement in the methods of observation.
It would be impossible to give even a slight sketch of
what has been done in the two departments of nature referred to
during the past few years. Mineralogical and geological research
have derived very great advantage from having been assigned to
professional teaching. But, as Professor Bonney reminds us, the
progress made in geological work in particular, has been directly
due to the revelations of the microscope. It called forth an instrument
of special construction for the purpose, the petrological
microscope (<a href="#fig_79">Fig. 79</a>), well equipped with Nicol’s prisms, and numerous
other appliances demanded for the important investigations.</p>

<p>“Upon the history of the two main groups of rocks the microscope
has thrown much light. For the igneous rocks it has simplified
their classification and determined their mutual relations; while for
the rudimentary group, it has shown the true nature of their
constituents, and pointed out the sources from which they were
derived. But it is in helping to elucidate the problem of the metamorphic
rocks, of which much less was known, that the microscope
has been of the most service. It has likewise greatly assisted in the
attempt to determine the history and mutual relation of these rocks.
One of the most important results within the last few years has
been the demonstration that without exception these crystallin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_671">671</span>
schists are very old, all probably older than the first rocks in which
traces of life have been found. The conclusion arrived at, is that
“the environment necessary for changing an ordinary sediment into
a crystalline schist existed generally only in the earliest ages, and
but very rarely and locally, if ever, since pal&aelig;ozoic time began.”</p>

<p>The crystalline schists then are the relics still preserved to us of the
early days of the earth’s history, when the temperature near the surface
was still high. Since that time the zone for marked mineralogical
changes has been continually sinking, until at the present day it
has reached a depth practically unattainable. “The subterranean
laboratory still exists, but the way to it was virtually closed at a
comparatively early period in the earth’s history.” Greater progress
has been made since the microscope was pressed into the service
of geology, and inspires the hope that we shall yet learn something
more of the earliest ages, when the mystery of life began.</p>

<p>“It may be regarded as one of the most remarkable results of
geological science, that an acquaintance with organic forms is at
least as necessary for a geologist as a knowledge of minerals, and
that a correct knowledge of organic remains (portions of fossil plants
and animals) should prove a more certain and unerring guide in
unravelling the structure of complicated districts of countries, than
the most wide and general acquaintance with inorganic substances.
The cause of this, however, is obvious, as the mineral substances
produced at any one period of a vast succession of ages, do not appear
to have had any essential difference from those formed under like
circumstances at another. The animals and plants, however, living
at one period of the earth’s history were widely different from those
living at other periods. There has been a continuous succession of
different races of living beings on the earth following each other in
a certain regular and ascertainable order, and when that order has
been determined, it is equally certain that we can at once assign to
its proper period of production, and therefore to its proper place in
the series of rocks, any portion of earthy matter we may meet with
containing any one, or even any recognisable fragment of one, of
these once living beings.”</p>

<p>The method of preparing sections of minerals and rocks for microscopic
examination will be found at pp. 241, 307-309. The
sections, it is almost needless to say, must be prepared thin enough
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_672">672</span>
to permit the use of transmitted light, as well as for that of polarised
light: that is to say, they should range from about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub>th to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>1000</sub>th
of an inch. Almost any lapidary will cut sections of any choice
specimen.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> The formation of crystals, and the method of preparing
them for examination, has also been fully explained in the chapter
on polarised light, pp. 219 et seq., and illustrated on <a href="#pl_viii">Plate VIII</a>.
It is well known in micro-chemistry that “almost every substance,
simple or compound, capable of existing in the solid state, assumes,
under favourable conditions, a distinct geometrical figure, usually
bounded by plane surfaces and having angles of constant value.</p>

<p>Much useful information may be gained upon micro-crystallography,
as well as on almost everything having any relation to the
<i>technique</i> of the microscope, in the “Journal of the Royal Microscopical
Society.” To the June number (1898) Mr. T. Charters White
contributes an article on crystals, and reminds us that the presence of
much or little moisture will modify and alter forms, as much and as
often as varying degrees of temperature. At the same time he offers
a few useful suggestions for the purpose of securing better results,
for which purpose he employs hippuric acid, hydroquinine, and picric
acid alone or in combination with hippuric acid, and an aqueous
solution of bichromate of potassium, crystallised in a tolerably thick
emulsion of gum arabic. This is the only aqueous solution; the
other solvents have been methylated spirit, acetone, and absolute
alcohol, taking these three solvents as types of the greatest volatility,
because in making certain crystals it is necessary that the solvent
should evaporate quickly, otherwise the crystals will assume their
original forms. It is further desirable to make saturated, or even
super-saturated solutions of the three chemicals named, as the colours
produced under polarised light are of a deeper and richer character
than they are if made from weaker solutions. Of the three chemicals
named he prefers hippuric acid, for reasons stated, that it is the most
manageable, and allows of more time being taken in modifying the
formation of the crystals. It is also advisable to slightly warm the
glass slide before the drop of fluid is applied. On the whole, picric
acid appears to furnish a greater variety of crystals when used in
combination with bichromate of potassium and a solution of gum arabic.

<h2 id="APPENDIX">APPENDICES AND TABLES USEFUL TO THE
MICROSCOPIST.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Appendix A.</span></h3>

<h4>ILLUMINATION ARRANGEMENTS OF THE
MICROSCOPE.</h4>

<p>A doubt has of late been expressed among practical microscopists as to the value
of the illumination arrangements of the lamp and the microscope, so as to secure the
more perfect definition of the flagellate organ of the monas and other minute forms
of infusorial life. We have been told that better results will be obtained by turning the
mirror aside, and so disposing the microscope and lamp in the horizontal position,
that the central rays of light from the mirror-edge of the lamp-flame shall pass through
the optical axis of the achromatic condenser, the focus of which must be accurately
brought upon the field of view by means of the substage centring screws and rack-work,
and in such a manner, that by employing a 1-inch objective, a sharply-defined
image of the lamp-flame, edge-on, is projected on to the centre of the field in association
with the specimen under examination. If the 1-inch objective be now replaced
by a 1-12th or 1-16th inch immersion and once again focussed into place, and a slight
re-adjustment of the centring made, it will be found that the field is brilliantly
illuminated, and the most minute portions of infusorial life are well defined, and
with a sharpness otherwise unattainable. At the same time the graduating or iris
diaphragm must be brought into use.</p>

<p>Dr. Clifford Mercer, the President of the American Microscopical Society, who has
quite recently reinvestigated the question of illumination, utterly condemns the narrow
cone, as well as that of oblique light in all such investigations, and considers the
3-4ths axil cone as the most suitable method for microscopical illumination, and he
bases his resolving limit accordingly. Some important experiments are brought
forward by Dr. Mercer, which at the same time demonstrate the correctness of Lord
Rayleigh’s limit of resolution (referred to in a previous chapter, p. 44), for circular
apertures as contrasted with that calculated by the late Sir George Airy.</p>

<p>With regard to the Abb&eacute; Theory, Dr. Mercer says: “Resolution in the Abb&eacute; Theory
may be said to increase by bounds. So long as the central image of the source of
light alone is to be seen at the back of the objective, resolution is not present. The
aperture may be increased without change in the contraction of the diffraction pattern,
and in accompanying resolution, so long as the central image alone is to be seen at
the back of the objective; but the moment the increase in aperture is sufficient to
uncover or admit one flanking spectrum image, resolution is present. With greater
increase in aperture, no improvement in the picture as to the contraction of the diffraction
pattern is to be seen until another spectrum image is uncovered or admitted. Dr.
Mercer gives his reasons for considering that the advantageous reduction in a cone of
light between an object and the objective should not exceed, in the case of first-class
objectives, one-fourth to one-third (never more than one-half) of the diameter of the
cone. On the other hand, with full cone illumination, resolution increases continuously,
and not by jumps or by periodic accessions. With regard to the use of oblique
light, he says his Photos 2, 3, and 4<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> are a pictorial warning for a second time
against the use of oblique illumination in ordinary work us a means of increasing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_674">674</span>
or of attempting to exhaust the resolving power of the microscope. At the same
time it becomes evident that every substage should be provided with a means by
which its condenser may be accurately centred, and that every student using the
microscope should be familiar with a method of centring his substage condenser.</p>

<p>Dr. Mercer summarises the results of his experiments thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. “Diffraction rays on leaving an object may be considered in the same category
with other rays changed in direction by an object.</p>

<p>2. “The diffraction phenomena seen in a projected image are essentially the effect
of changes in light <i>above</i> the objective, due to a function of aperture, and not to
changes <i>below</i> the objective, due to diffraction of light in the plane of the object.</p>

<p>3. “Diffraction in the plane of the object does, under some circumstances, furnish
light to certain parts of an aperture from which primary rays are absent, and this
enables aperture to more fully determine the character of the projected image, resulting
in a more nearly truthful image, or, on the other hand, in false appearances. This
is the gist of the Abb&eacute; phenomena of microscopic vision.</p>

<p>4. “But such phenomena are not peculiar to microscopic vision, notwithstanding
Professor Abb&eacute;’s claim to the contrary.</p>

<p>5. “With any positive lens similar and more brilliant results may be got by
utilising corresponding pencils of primary rays, instead of isolated pencils of diffracted
rays.</p>

<p>6. “Still more trustworthy results may be got by using primary rays in place of
the isolated pencils of primary rays.</p>

<p>7. “An advantage peculiar to using narrow cone illumination with an objective of
wide aperture (the only illumination admissible in the Abb&eacute; theory), consists in
giving, under suitable conditions, approximately the acme of resolving power simultaneously
in each several diameters. Thus a circular aperture is approximately
squared or made rectangular as to resolving power in several of its diameters
simultaneously.</p>

<p>8. “Special attention is called to the fact that the Abb&eacute; theory deals with complex
objects; for only such objects are subject to resolution. Single particles and uniform
areas are outside its domain. These latter, however, are microscopic objects, and all
objects are essentially different shaped aggregations of points. An isolated point-like
particle, no matter what its minuteness, may be seen if it present sufficient contrast
with the surrounding microscopic field. The size of the disc image is no less than a
limit determined finally by aperture. That limit in size varying inversely with
aperture, determines the limit of resolving power. This is the gist of the theory of
microscopic vision which harmonises with our experimental study of aperture.”</p>

<h4>MICRO-PHOTOGRAPHY.</h4>

<p>Owing in some measure to the more complete knowledge of the subject gained
by the experience of years, and the extreme value of micro-photography in the
delineation of bacteria, and perhaps in a measure to the advent of the perfected
dry-plate process, photography is being rapidly pressed forward in conjunction with the
microscope. In the course of the year [1898] no less than six, more or less, new forms
of micro-photographic apparatus have appeared; two are simple, one for daylight,
one for lamp, one for electric, and one for lime-light illumination. Passing over
the simpler forms, for a notice of which I am unable to find room, there is one piece
of new apparatus, that of Mr. E. B. Stringer, which is not only new, but is in every
way adapted to the work of micro-photography. It is in fact a well-arranged
camera, fitted with a powerful condensing arrangement, each portion of which is
capable of being independently centred and controlled. Indeed, the specially
interesting feature of the apparatus is the control of the gas and the beautiful
and uniformally illuminating disc of zircon, about a quarter of an inch in diameter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>This efficient photo-micrographic apparatus (<a href="#fig_446">Fig. 446</a>) is made by Messrs. W.
Watson &amp; Sons, under the instructions of Mr. E. B. Stringer. The illuminating
condensing system is mounted on a square brass bar, the illuminant being oxygen-hydrogen
light burning on zirconium. Immediately in front of this is a condenser, c,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_675">675</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_676">676</span>
four and a half inches diameter, with an iris diaphragm, <small>D</small>, immediately in front of it.
The holder, <small>E</small>, carries the light filtering media through which the beam passes and
enters the condenser, <small>F</small>. It then goes through a tank of water contained in the
cone, <small>F</small> to <small>H</small>, and emerges a practically parallel beam of great intensity through a
plano-concave lens, h, of such a diameter as to exactly fill the back lens of the
substage condenser. There is an iris diaphragm, <small>T</small>, for cutting off stray light.</p>

<p>The whole of the apparatus is fitted with centring screws and clamps, and after
having been once adjusted it is ready for use at any moment without preparation.
By means of this apparatus, instantaneous pictures can be taken of living rotifers, so
brilliant is the illumination, while photographs of such fine objects as the flagella of
bacteria cannot be secured with the same amount of certainty by any other microphotographic
apparatus with which I have made myself acquainted.</p>

<p class="x-large caption">FORMUL&AElig; AND METHODS:&mdash;CEMENTING, CLEARING,
HARDENING AND MOUNTING.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<h4>CLEARING AGENTS.</h4>

<p>The object of employing a clearing agent is to replace the alcohol in the dehydrated
section by a liquid which has a refractive index about the same as the balsam into
which it is to be placed, and which will readily mix with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oil of Bergamot</span> will clear quickly from 90 per cent. of alcohol. Clove oil clears
more rapidly, but it dissolves out aniline colours to a considerable extent. Xylol
is without action on aniline colours. This strength of alcohol is chosen because
of its being that of the methylated spirit sold in London, and which is much used in
washing and dehydrating on account of its cheapness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oil of Cedar Wood</span>, although an essential oil, resembles xylol, but evaporates
slowly. It has very little solvent action on the aniline colours. It clears rapidly
from absolute alcohol, but not well from 90 per cent. Sections can be left in it for
several days. It is a convenient medium in which to examine tissues before mounting
them permanently. It clears celloidin without dissolving it; and as a connecting
fluid between the object and objective nothing better has been discovered.</p>

<p>Other clearing agents have been tried, but as they dissolve out the aniline colours,
are no longer used.</p>

<h4>CEMENTS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Grove’s Mastic and Bismuth.</span>&mdash;Dissolve gum mastic in chloroform, and thicken
with nitrate of bismuth. The solution of mastic should be nearly saturated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grove’s Oxide of Zinc, Dammar, and Drying Oil.</span>&mdash;Rub up well-ground oxide
of zinc, 2 ozs., with drying oil, to the consistence of thick paint. Then add an equal
quantity of gum dammar, previously dissolved in benzoline, and of the thickness
of syrup. Strain through close-meshed muslin. Keep in well-corked bottle, and,
if necessary, thin with benzoline.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isinglass Cement.</span>&mdash;Heat the isinglass in a covered vessel on the water-bath with
a little glacial acetic acid, until it is thoroughly softened and forms a stiff mass, then
gradually add more acid until it produces a thick solution which is of uniform consistence,
and just fluid while hot. Then run into wide-mouth bottles and close with
good corks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitton’s Cement</span> of white lead and red lead in powder, and litharge powder in
equal parts. Grind together with a little turpentine, until thoroughly incorporated,
and mix with gold size. The mixture should be thin enough to use with a brush;
in using, one coat should be allowed to dry before applying another. No more
cement should be mixed with the gold size than is required for immediate use, as it
sets quickly, and becomes unworkable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_677">677</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kr&ouml;nig’s Cement.</span>&mdash;Gradually add ordinary resin, 7 to 9 parts, to melted beeswax,
2 parts, then steam and cool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shellac Cement.</span>&mdash;Dissolve shellac in an equal weight of methylated spirit, then
pour off the clear portion and add a few drops of balsam and castor oil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marine Glue.</span>&mdash;Dissolve indiarubber in mineral naphtha, and add twice the
quantity of powdered shellac; or make chloroform the solvent, and use mastic
instead of shellac. For casting battery trays, use a composition of 4 parts resin and
1 of gutta percha, with a little boiled oil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selier</span> (<i>Cleaning Glass Slides</i>).&mdash;New slides or cover-glasses must be placed for a
few hours in a mixture of 1 part of potassium bichromate, 1 of sulphuric acid, and
25 of water. Subsequently wash with water and wipe dry with a linen rag, after
draining off the excess of moisture. Covers that have been used should be previously
immersed for a few days in a mixture of equal parts of alcohol and hydrochloric acid.
Scrape old slides free of mounting medium before immersing them in the bichromate
solution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elsching’s Celloidin Solution.</span>&mdash;Allow the celloidin shavings to swell up for
24 hours in the necessary quantity of absolute alcohol, then add the proper amount
of ether.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Koch’s Copal.</span>&mdash;Stain small pieces of material in bulk, and dehydrate with
alcohol, then immerse in a thin solution of copal in chloroform. Evaporate with
a gentle heat until the solution is so far concentrated as to draw out into threads that
are brittle on cooling. Then remove the objects and leave on a tile for a few days to
dry. Sections may then be cut by means of a fine saw. If objects are imbedded
unstained, remove copal from sections by soaking in chloroform, decalcify if necessary,
and stain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eulenstein’s Cement.</span>&mdash;Mix equal parts of Brunswick black and gold size with a
very little Canada balsam.</p>

<h4>DECALCIFYING AND BLEACHING.</h4>

<p>In the case of bony structures, or tissues so impregnated with calcium salts, the
material should be decalcified by an acid capable of dissolving out the mineral matter.
Hydrochloric acid with alcohol is in more general use. The older the bone the
stronger will be the acid required, nitric with alcohol and chromic acid. Picric acid
is preferred for fœtal bone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andeer, J. J.</span>, finds an aqueous solution of phloroglucin acts as a powerful
decalcifying agent on the bones of animals, but is without action on the most delicate
organic tissue. If treatment with hydrochloric acid be employed as well, the
residual “ossein” will be without a trace of either calcium phosphate or carbonate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ebner’s Fluids.</span>&mdash;(1) Mix 100 C.c. of cold saturated aqueous solution of sodium
chloride, 100 C.c. of water, and 4 C.c. of hydrochloric acid. Preparations are placed
in the fluid, and 1 to 2 C.c. of hydrochloric acid added daily until they are soft.
(2) Mix 2·5 parts of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1·16) with 500 of alcohol (90 per cent.),
100 of water, and 2·5 of sodium chloride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fol’s Liquid.</span>&mdash;Mix 70 volumes of 1 per cent. chromic acid, 3 of nitric acid, and
200 of water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mayer’s Desilification Process.</span>&mdash;Place the objects in alcohol contained in
a glass vessel coated internally with paraffin, then add hydrofluoric acid drop by drop
until desilification is complete, avoiding the fumes meanwhile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marsh’s Chlorine Method.</span>&mdash;Chlorine is generated in a small bottle by treating
crystals of potassium chlorate with strong HCl., and the gas is led through a piece
of glass tubing, bent twice at right angles, to the bottom of a bottle containing the
sections immersed in water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ranvier’s Fluid.</span>&mdash;Use 50 per cent. hydrochloric acid with the addition of sodium
chloride to counteract its swelling action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Squire’s Fluid.</span>&mdash;(1) Mix 95 parts of glycerine with 5 parts of hydrochloric acid;
used for softening teeth. (2) Use a 4 per cent. aqueous solution of arsenic acid at
a temperature of 30&deg; to 40&deg; C. After softening tissues in this solution, keep them
in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Waldeyer.</span>&mdash;To a 0·1 per cent. solution of palladium chloride, add one-tenth its

<h4>HARDENING, FREEZING, AND EMBEDDING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Altmann</span> (<i>Fixing Solution</i>).&mdash;A mixture of equal parts of 5 per cent. potassium
bichromate solution and 2 per cent. osmic acid.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_678">678</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcohol.</span>&mdash;Strengths of alcoholic solutions, as given by Squire, will be found of
practical value. Absolute alcohol (sp. gr. O·797) containing about 98 per cent. of ethylic
alcohol is taken as the basis in most instances. Alcohol of 90 per cent. (sp. gr. 0·823)
is prepared by mixing 14 volumes of absolute alcohol and 1 volume of distilled water;
84 per cent. alcohol (sp. gr. 0·838) is rectified spirit B.P.; 70 per cent. alcohol (sp. gr.
0·872) may be obtained by adding 1 volume of distilled water to 3 volumes of absolute
alcohol, 6 volumes of rectified spirit, or 4 volumes of methylated spirit; 50 per cent.
alcohol (sp. gr. 0·918) is prepared by adding 4 volumes of distilled water to 5 volumes
of absolute alcohol, 3 volumes of water to 5 volumes of rectified spirit, or 3·5
volumes of water to 5 volumes of methylated spirit. Absolute alcohol, 75 C.c., mixed
with acetic acid, 25 C.c., serves as an excellent fixing agent for nuclei. Immerse
tissues in it for 6 to 12 hours, then transfer to 90 per cent. alcohol until hardened,
afterwards preserving in 70 per cent. alcohol till wanted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betz’s Hardening Fluid.</span>&mdash;A mixture of equal parts of sulphuric ether and

<h4>MOUNTING MEDIA.</h4>

<p>Sections are usually mounted in balsam, dammar, glycerine, &amp;c., but it is not a
necessity that the cover-glass should be fixed or cemented down. Some cements
(caoutchouc by preference) should be employed when glycerine or aqueous (Farrant’s)
media are used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alleger’s Gelatine Process.</span>&mdash;Add a few drops of formalin to each gramme of

<p><span class="smcap">Cole’s Slow or Exposure Method of Mounting.</span>&mdash;Dissolve dried Canada
balsam, 3 ozs., in benzole, 3 fl. ozs., and filter. Apply a clean cover-glass to a slide
that has been moistened by breathing on it, and place a few drops of the balsam
solution on the cover-glass. Then remove a section from turpentine, and put it into
the balsam. Put aside for 12 hours to allow the benzole to evaporate, and having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_679">679</span>
warmed a slide and added a drop of fresh balsam solution to that on the cover-glass,
bring the fluid balsam in contact with the warmed slide. Press the cover down
carefully to avoid the inclusion of air bubbles, and when the excess of balsam is
squeezed out, put the slide aside to cool, after which it may be cleaned with a camel-hair
brush or soft rag moistened with methylated spirit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant’s Solution.</span>&mdash;Take of gum arabic 5 parts; water 5 parts; when the gum is

it contains 0·75 to 0·50 per cent. of the salt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kaiser’s Bismarck Brown Stain.</span> Sections are stained for 48 hours, at a temperature
of 60 C., in a saturated solution of Bismarck brown in 60 per cent. alcohol,
and washed out in 60 per cent. alcohol containing 2 per cent. of H.C.L., or 3 per cent.
of acetic acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kaiser’s Nerve Stain.</span>&mdash;This is a modification of Weigert’s process. The material
is hardened in M&uuml;ller’s solution for 2 or 3 days, then cut into slices 2 to 4 Mm. thick,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_683">683</span>
and treated with the solution for 5 or 6 days more. Subsequently immerse in
Marchi’s solution for 8 days, then wash, pass through alcohol, and imbed in celloidin.
Sections are mordanted for 5 minutes in the following mixture:&mdash;Solutions of ferric
chloride, 1 part; distilled water, 1 part; rectified spirit, 8 parts. Next wash in
Weigert’s h&aelig;matoxylin, and warm in a fresh quantity of the same for a few minutes,
wash with water, differentiate in Pal’s solution, and neutralise the oxalic acid by
washing in water containing a little ammonia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kaiser’s Stain for the Spinal Cord.</span>&mdash;Sections are stained for a few hours in
solution of n&aacute;phthylamine brown, 1 part, in water, 200 parts, and alcohol, 100 parts.
Afterwards wash with alcohol and clear with origanum oil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kallin’s Neurological Method.</span>&mdash;Dissolve hydroquinone, 5 Gm., sodium sulphite,
40 Gm., and potassium carbonate, 75 Gm., in 25 Gm. of distilled water. At the time
of using, dilute this solution with one-third to one-half its bulk of absolute alcohol;
immerse sections of silvered material for several minutes until reduction is complete.
Then place them in 70 per cent. alcohol for 10 to 15 minutes, and subsequently
leave in aqueous solution of sodium hyposulphite (1:5) for 24 hours or more. Finally
dehydrate and mount. Carmine may be used as an afterstain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kleinenberg’s Solution</span> (<i>Improved Formula</i>).&mdash;H&aelig;matoxylin, 2&frac12; Gm.; crystallised
calcium chloride, 20 Gm. in 10 C.c. of distilled water; alum, 3 Gm. in
16 C.c. of distilled water; rectified spirit, 240 C.c. Dissolve the calcium chloride and
alum in their respective quantities of water by the aid of heat; mix the solutions
and immediately dilute with rectified spirit; after an hour filter and add the h&aelig;matoxylin.
This makes a good working solution which keeps well. Of course it contains
the alumina in solution, not as alum but aluminium chloride. If in special cases
the colour is considered too strong, the dilution (when staining in bulk) must be
made with some of the solution to which h&aelig;matoxylin has not been added.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Koch’s Method for Staining Flagella.</span>&mdash;Immerse cover-glass preparations in
a 1 per cent. aqueous solution of h&aelig;matoxylin, then transfer to a 5 per cent. solution
of chromic acid or to M&uuml;ller’s fluid; dry and mount in balsam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Koch-Ehrlich, Bacilli.</span>&mdash;Place sections, or cover-glass preparations, for at least
12 hours in gentian violet, or fuchsine aniline water (aniline water, 100 C.c.; concentrated
alcoholic solution of gentian violet, or fuchsine, 11 C.c.; absolute alcohol,
10 C.c.), then immerse in a mixture of pure nitric acid (sp. gr. 1·42), 10 C.c., and
distilled water, 30 C.c., for some seconds. Rinse in 60 per cent. alcohol for a few
minutes, and then counterstain with vesuvine (vesuvine, 0·5 Gm.; rectified spirit,
20 C.c.; distilled water, 80 C.c.) after gentian violet; or methylene blue (methylene
blue, 0·25 Gm.; rectified spirit, 20 C.c.; distilled water, 80 C.c.) after fuchsine.
Finally rinse in water, dehydrate, clear, and mount in balsam. According to Squire,
who points out that nitric acid is apt to injure delicate sections, Watson Cheyne
recommends that sections should be transferred from fuchsine aniline water to
distilled water, then rinsed in alcohol, and placed in the following contrast stain for
1 or 2 hours:&mdash;Saturated alcoholic solution of methylene blue, 20 C.c.; distilled
water, 100 C.c.; formic acid (sp. gr. 1·2), 1 C.c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">K&uuml;hne’s Carbolic Methylene Blue.</span>&mdash;Rub up 1·5 Gm. of methylene blue with
10 C.c. of absolute alcohol, and add 100 C.c. of a 5 per cent. aqueous solution of
carbolic acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">K&uuml;hne’s Methyl Violet Solution.</span>&mdash;Dissolve 1 Gm. of methyl violet in 90 C.c.
of distilled water and 100 C.c. of alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">K&uuml;hne’s Aniline Oil Solutions.</span>&mdash;Rub up as much methylene blue, methyl
green, or safranine as will go upon the point of a knife, with 10 C.c. of aniline, and
allow to settle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">K&uuml;hne’s Carbolic Fuchsine or Black Brown.</span>&mdash;Dissolve 1 Gm. of fuchsine or
black brown in 10 C.c. of absolute alcohol, and add 100 C.c. of a 5 per cent. aqueous
solution of carbolic acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">K&uuml;hne’s Modification of Gram’s Method.</span>&mdash;Stain nuclei with carmine, then
treat sections for 5 minutes in methyl violet solution, diluted one-sixth with a 1 per
cent. aqueous solution of ammonium carbonate, or in a solution of Victoria blue,
0·25 Gm., in rectified spirit, 20 C.c., and distilled water, 80 C.c. Next rinse thoroughly
in water and transfer to Grain’s solution for 2 to 3 minutes; again rinse in water and
extract excess of stain with solution of yellow fluorescine, 1 Gm., in absolute alcohol,
50 C.c. Finally, pass through pure alcohol, aniline, terebene, and xylol, and mount
in balsam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">L&ouml;ffler’s Solution.</span>&mdash;Concentrated alcoholic solution of methylene blue, 30 C.c.;
solution of (caustic potash) potassium hydrate (1:10,000), 100 C.c. Mix and filter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_684">684</span>
shortly before use. Sections are stained for a few minutes (tubercle sections for some
hours), and excess of stain can be removed by immersion for a few seconds in 0·5
per cent. acetic acid. Dehydrate in absolute alcohol, clear in cedar oil, and mount in
balsam. L&ouml;ffler found that most bacteria stained better in this solution than in the
weaker solutions used by Koch for turbercle bacillus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lavdowsky’s Bilberry Juice Stain.</span>&mdash;Well wash the fresh berries of <i>Vaccinium
myrtillus</i>, then express the juice and mix with twice its bulk of distilled water,
mixed with a little 90 per cent. alcohol. Heat for a short time and filter whilst warm.
Dilute the stain with 2 or 3 volumes of distilled water before use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee’s Formaldehyde Solutions.</span>&mdash;(1) Mix 1 part of 40 per cent. formaldehyde
solution with two parts of 1 per cent. chromic acid solution, and add 4 per cent. of
acetic acid. (2) Mix 1 part of 40 per cent. formaldehyde solution with 4 parts of
1 per cent. platinic chloride solution, and add 2 per cent. of acetic acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee’s Osmic Acid and Pyrogallol Stain.</span>&mdash;Fix the tissues in Hermann’s mixture
or Flemming’s mixture for half an hour, then place in a weak solution of pyrogallol,
which may be prepared with alcohol in some cases. Safranine may be used as a
second stain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martinotti’s Picro-nigrosine Stain.</span>&mdash;Pathological objects are stained for 2 or
3 hours or days, in a saturated solution of nigrosine in saturated alcoholic picric acid
solution. Then wash out in a mixture of 1 part of formic acid with 2 parts of alcohol
until the grey matter appears clearly differentiated from the white to the naked
eye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mayer’s Aluminium Chloride Carmine.</span>&mdash;Dissolve 1 Gm. of carminic acid and
3 Gm. of aluminium chloride in 200 C.c. of water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mayer’s Berlin Blue Injection.</span>&mdash;Add a solution of 10 C.c. of tincture of ferric
chloride in 500 C.c. of water, to a solution of 20 Gm. of potassium ferrocyanide in
500 C.c. of water, allow to stand for 12 hours, decant, wash the deposit for 1 or 2 days
with distilled water until the washings come through dark blue, then dissolve the
blue in about a litre of water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mayer’s Carmalum.</span>&mdash;Dissolve 1 Gm. of carminic acid and 10 Gm. of alum in
200 C.c. of distilled water; decant, or filter, and add a few crystals of thymol,
0·1 per cent. of salicylic acid, or 0·5 per cent. of sodium salicylate. A weaker
solution contains 3 to 5 times as much alum and 5 times as much water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Merbel’s Carmine and Indigo Fluids</span> (give a blue and red stain, and are very
selective).&mdash;To prepare the red fluid, take&mdash;Carmine, 2 dr.; borax, 2 dr.; distilled
water, 4 ozs. For the blue fluid, take&mdash;Indigo carmine, 2 dr.; borax, 2 dr.; distilled
water, 4 ozs. Mix each in a mortar, and allow it to stand, then pour off the supernatant
fluid. If the sections have been hardened in chromic acid, picric acid, or a
bichromate, they must be washed in water till no tinge appears. Place them in
alcohol for fifteen or twenty minutes, then in the two fluids mixed in equal proportions,
after which wash them in a saturated aqueous solution of oxalic acid, where
they should remain a rather shorter time than in the staining fluids. When
sufficiently bleached, wash them in water, to get rid of the acid, then pass them
through spirit and oil of cloves, and mount in balsam or dammar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mitrophanow’s Gold Process for Prickle-Cells and Intercellular Canals.</span>&mdash;Wash
the tail of an axolotl larva with distilled water, place for an hour in a watch-glassful
of 0·25 per cent. solution of gold chloride, containing 1 drop of hydrochloric
acid; wash, and reduce in a mixture of 1 part of formic acid with 6 parts of water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mitrophanow’s Maceration Method for Epithelium.</span>&mdash;Fix the embryo for 15
minutes in 3 per cent. nitric acid; then place for an hour in a mixture of alcohol,
1 volume, and water 2 volumes, and finally treat with stronger alcohol for 24 hours to
separate the epidermis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M&uuml;ller’s Berlin Blue for Injections.</span>&mdash;Precipitate a concentrated solution of
Berlin blue by means of 90 per cent. alcohol. The precipitate is very finely divided,
whilst the fluid is perfectly neutral and much easier to prepare than that of Beale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neilsen’s Solution of Methyl Violet.</span>&mdash;Dissolve fuchsine, 1 part, in alcohol,
10 parts, and add a 5 per cent. watery solution of carbolic acid, 100 parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neisser’s Double-Staining for Spore-Bearing Bacilli.</span>&mdash;Cover-glass preparations
are immersed for 20 minutes in fuchsine aniline water (concentrated alcoholic
solution of fuchsine, 11 C.c.; absolute alcohol, 10 C.c.; aniline water, 100 C.c.; then
heat to 80&deg; or 90&deg; C.; next rinse in water, alcohol, or weak acid, according to the
nature of the bacilli, counterstain with aqueous solution of methylene blue, rinse in
water, dry and mount in balsam). The spores are stained red and the rest of the
bacilli blue.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_685">685</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nissl’s Fuchsine Stain for Nerve Cells.</span>&mdash;(1) Fresh material in pieces measuring
1 C.c. are hardened in a “chromic solution in 70 per cent. alcohol” for 2 days,
then transferred to absolute alcohol for 5 days, and afterwards cut. Stain the sections
singly in a saturated solution of fuchsine, warming in a deep watch-glass until vapours
begin to be given off. Next plunge the section into absolute alcohol for 1 or 2
minutes, then place it on a slide, flood with clove oil, and when no more colour is
given off, drain and mount in balsam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ohlmacher’s Formaldehyde Staining.</span>&mdash;Formalin in a 2 to 4 per cent. solution
is used as a mordant for tar colours. The tissues may be mordanted separately by
treatment for 1 minute or longer, or the formalin may be added to the stain. Dissolve
1 Gm. of fuchsine in 10 C.c. of absolute alcohol, and add to 100 C.c. of 4 per cent.
formalin solution. Or, add saturated alcoholic solution of gentian violet or methyl
violet 5 B. to the formalin solution, in the proportion of 1:10. In the case of methylene
blue, dissolve 1 G.m. in 100 C.c. of the formalin solution. Sections stain in
half a minute, and are said to resist alcohol much more than if formalin were not
used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oppitz’s Silver Staining.</span>&mdash;Reduction is very rapidly effected by placing the
preparations for 2 or 3 minutes in a 0·25 to 0·5 per cent. solution of chloride of tin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pal’s H&aelig;matoxylin Stain.</span>&mdash;Dissolve 0·75 Gm. of h&aelig;matoxylin in 90 C.c. of
distilled water and 10 C.c. of absolute alcohol. Just before use add saturated solution
of lithium carbonate in the proportion of 3 drops to each 10 C.c. of h&aelig;matoxylin
solution. (See Weigert.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pal’s H&aelig;matoxylin Method.</span>&mdash;Proceed at first as in Weigert’s process for nerve
fibre, omitting the copper bath, and stain in Pal’s h&aelig;matoxylin solution (see above)
for 5 or 6 hours. Then wash the sections in distilled water (containing a trace of
lithium carbonate if the sections are not deep blue), next treat for 15 to 30 seconds
with a 0·25 per cent. potassium permanganate solution, rinse in water, and decolourise
in Pal’s bleaching solution. (If black spots appear replace in the permanganate
solution, again bleach, and wash for 15 minutes in water.) The grey substance of
the sections is decolourised in a few sections; the sections should then be well washed
out, and may be double-stained with picro-carmine or acetic acid carmine (see
Schneider), Magdala red, or eosine. The nuclei may be stained with alum carmine.
Finally dehydrate, clear, and mount.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pal-Exner’s Osmic Acid Method.</span>&mdash;Spinal cord or brain in 0·25 inch cubes is
immersed in 0·5 per cent. osmic acid solution for 2 days, the solution being changed
each day; then wash in water, transfer to absolute alcohol, and imbed in celloidin or
paraffin. Place sections as cut in glycerine, then wash in water, treat with potassium
permanganate and Pal’s solution, as in Pal’s h&aelig;matoxylin method, counter-stain with
carmine, dehydrate, clear, and mount in balsam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plant’s Method of Staining Actinomycosis.</span>&mdash;Sections are placed for 10 minutes
in Gibbes’ magenta solution or carbolic fuchsine, at 45&deg; C.; next they are rinsed in
water and placed in saturated aqueous solution of picric acid, mixed with an equal
volume of absolute alcohol, for 5 or 10 minutes; they are then washed once more,
passed through 50 per cent. alcohol into absolute alcohol, cleared in cedar oil, and
mounted in balsam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ranvier’s Lemon Juice Method.</span>&mdash;Soak pieces of fresh tissue in fresh lemon juice
until transparent (5 to 10 minutes), then rapidly wash in distilled water, treat for 10
to 60 minutes with 1 per cent. gold chloride solution, again wash and expose to light
in a bottle containing 50 C.c. of distilled water and 2 drops of acetic acid. Reduction
is complete in 24 to 48 hours. If it is not desired to retain the superficial epithelium,
reduction may be more completely effected in the dark, by treatment with formic acid
(sp. gr. 1·2), diluted with 3 times its volume of water. The lemon juice in the
above process may be replaced by an aqueous solution of citric acid (40 grains in each
ounce).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ranvier’s Picro-Carmine.</span>&mdash;Carmine, 1 part; distilled water, 10 parts; solution of
ammonia, 3 parts; mix and add of a cold saturated solution of picric acid 200 parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Renaut’s H&aelig;matoxylic Eosine.</span>&mdash;Mix 30 C.c. of concentrated aqueous solution of
eosine, 40 C.c. of saturated alcoholic solution of h&aelig;matoxylin (which has been kept
for some time and precipitated), and 130 C.c. of saturated solution of potash alum in
glycerine (sp. gr. 1·26). Stand for 5 or 6 weeks in a partially covered vessel, protected
from dust, until the alcohol is evaporated, and then filter. The filtrate can be diluted
with glycerine if desired. Mount objects in this fluid diluted with 1 or 2 volumes of
glycerine, or, stain separately for some days or weeks and mount in balsam, after
washing in alcohol charged with a sufficient quantity of eosine.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_686">686</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ranvier and Vignal’s Osmium Mixture.</span>&mdash;Fix tissues in a freshly-prepared mixture
of equal volumes of 1 per cent. osmic acid and 90 per cent. alcohol, then wash
out in 80 per cent. alcohol, next with water, and stain for 48 hours with picro-carmine
or h&aelig;matoxylin. This method has been applied to the histology of insects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Renaut’s Glycerine H&aelig;matoxylin.</span>&mdash;To a saturated solution of potash alum in
glycerine, add a saturated solution of homatoxylin in 90 per cent. alcohol drop by
drop, so as to form a deeply coloured solution. Expose to daylight for a week, and
then filter. This solution, like Renaut’s h&aelig;matoxylic cosine, may be used for
mounting unstained sections, which after some time absorb the colour from the liquid
and become stained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Safranine.</span>&mdash;Safranine, 0·5 Gm.; rectified spirit, 20 C.c.; distilled water, 80 C.c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sch&auml;fer’s Acid Logwood Solution</span> is especially useful for certain structures, as
tendon, cells, &amp;c. It is thus prepared:&mdash;A 1 per cent. solution of acetic acid is coloured
by the addition of 1·3 of its volume of logwood solution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sch&auml;fer’s Aniline Dyes</span>, whether in aqueous or alcoholic solutions, give good
results, and are prepared as follows:&mdash;Roseanilin or magenta (1 gr. to 1 oz. of alcohol),
red; acetate of mauvein (4 gr., alcohol 1 oz., acid nitric 2 drops), blue; aniline black
(2 gr., water 1 oz.), grey-black; Nicholson’s soluble blue (1-6 gr., alcohol 1 oz., and
nitric 2 m.), blue. These stains should be used weak; and after sections are stained
they should be passed through alcohol and oil of cloves as rapidly as possible; otherwise
the colour will dissolve out before they can be mounted in balsam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schultze</span> (<i>Staining Bacilli</i>).&mdash;Stain sections and cover-glass preparations for
some hours in aqueous methylene blue solution, differentiate in 0·5 per cent. acetic
acid, dehydrate in alcohol, clear in cedar oil, and mount in balsam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sclavo’s Stain for Flagella.</span>&mdash;Leave the preparations for 1 minute in a solution
of 1 Gm. of tannin in 100 C.c. of 50 per cent. alcohol; wash in distilled water; transfer
for 1 minute to 50 per cent. phospho-molybdic acid; again wash, and stain for 3 to 5
minutes in a hot saturated solution of fuchsine in aniline water. Then wash in water,
dry on filter paper, and mount in balsam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Squire’s Picro-Carmine.</span>&mdash;(1) Dissolve 1 Gm. of carmine with a gentle heat in 3 C.c.
of strong solution of ammonia, and 5 C.c. of distilled water, then add 200 C.c. of
saturated aqueous solution of picric acid, heat to boiling, and filter. (2) Dissolve 10
Gm. of carmine in a solution of 1 Gm. of caustic soda in 1000 C.c. of distilled water;
boil, filter and make up to 1000 C.c. with water. Mix the solution with an equal
quantity of water, and add 1 per cent. aqueous solution of picric acid so long as the
turbidity produced disappears on agitation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Squire’s Blueing of Sections.</span>&mdash;After staining with h&aelig;matoxylin, treat for a few
seconds with a solution of sodium bicarbonate (1:1000) in distilled water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valentine</span> (<i>Fuchsine</i>).&mdash;Ether shaken with a solution containing fuchsine is
coloured violet after adding ferrous iodide, but not before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Victoria Blue.</span>&mdash;Victoria blue, 0·25 Gm.; rectified spirit, 20 C.c.; distilled
water, 80 C.c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedl’s Orseille or Orchella Stain.</span>&mdash;Mix 5 C.c. of acetic acid, 20 C.c. of
absolute alcohol, and 40 C.c. of distilled water; then add sufficient archil, from
which excess of ammonia has been driven off, to form a dark reddish fluid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weigert’s H&aelig;matoxylin.</span>&mdash;Dissolve 1 part of h&aelig;matoxylin in 10 parts of absolute
alcohol; then add 90 parts of distilled water and 1 part of aqueous solution (1:70) of
lithium carbonate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weigert</span> (<i>Gram’s Method</i>).&mdash;In this modification aniline is substituted for alcohol,
in order to avoid prolonged washing with the latter, and the process is conducted on
a slide. The section is placed on a slide, stained with a few drops of gentian violet
aniline water, prepared as in Gram’s method, the excess of fluid removed, and a few
drops of Gram’s solution applied. Subsequently remove the liquid by gently blotting
it off, then wash the section by allowing aniline to flow’ backwards and forwards over
it, and when colour ceases to come away, repeat the operation with xylol for about
1 minute, then mount in balsam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weigert</span> (<i>Staining in Actinomycosis</i>).&mdash;Immerse sections for 1 hour in Wedl’s
Orseille stain, then quickly rinse with alcohol and counterstain with gentian violet.
If it be desired to stain the mycelium also, afterwards submit the sections to
Weigert’s modification of Gram’s method. See page 335.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weigert</span> (<i>Staining Brain Tissue</i>).&mdash;Pieces of brain and spinal cord are hardened
in bichromate solution, followed by alcohol, then imbedded in celloidin or gum. If
imbedded in celloidin, the pieces are subsequently taken from the spirit in which
they are immersed, and placed for one or two days in saturated aqueous solution of
copper acetate, diluted with an equal bulk of water, the mixture being kept at about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_687">687</span>
40&deg; C. Afterwards transfer the pieces to 80 per cent. alcohol until required for
cutting. Or, the sections can be cut first, and then treated with copper acetate. To
stain the sections, after being well washed in 90 per cent. alcohol, they are transferred
to Weigert’s h&aelig;matoxylin and left from a few hours to two days, according to the
differentiation required. When opaque and of a deep blue-black colour, they should
be well washed for two or three days in distilled water. Next decolourise for 0·5 to 2
hours in a solution of 2 Gm. of borax and 2·5 Gm. of potassium ferrocyanide in
200 C.c. of water. As soon as the grey and white substances are sharply defined,
again wash the sections in water for half an hour, then dehydrate, clear, and mount
in balsam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woodhead’s Method of Staining Tubercle Bacilli.</span>&mdash;Take a small quantity
of sputum rich in bacilli, and spread it out by pressure between two cover-glasses, so
that a fairly thin film remains on each. Then carefully slip one over the other until
they come apart. Thoroughly dry the covers, and pass them rapidly three times
through the flame of a spirit lamp, care being taken not to scorch the film, then float
them face downwards on the staining solution, which has been previously prepared
and filtered into a watch-glass. The stain should consist of saturated alcoholic
solution of basic fuchsine, 1 part; absolute alcohol or rectified spirit, 10 parts;
carbolic acid solution (5 per cent.), 10 parts. Leave the preparations in the watch-glass
for 12 to 24 hours, unless time is an object. In the latter case heat the fluid gently
until vapour is given off, then drop the films on the surface, and leave them for 3 to 5
minutes only. Next transfer the covers to an aqueous solution of sulphuric acid
(25 per cent.), and when decolourisation is complete, as evidenced by the pink colouration
not returning when the specimens are plunged into a bowl of tap-water containing
a single drop of ammonia solution, thoroughly rinse in the slightly alkaline water and
counter-stain in an aqueous solution of methylene blue. Finally, wash in water,
carefully dry and mount in Canada balsam. The bacilli should stand out as bright
red rods on a blue background of cells.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ziehl-Neelsen</span> (<i>Staining Bacilli</i>).&mdash;Sections are removed from weak spirit into
Neelsen’s carbolic fuchsine and left for 10 or 15 minutes; next decolourise in sulphuric
acid (sp. gr. 1·84) or nitric acid (sp. gr. 1·42) diluted with 3 volumes of water, rinse
in 60 per cent. alcohol, and wash in a large volume of water to remove the acid.
Tubercle and leprosy bacilli are the only micro-organisms that can retain the stain
after treatment with acid. If the presence of traces of nitrous acid in the nitric acid
be suspected, Squire recommends the use of saturated aqueous solution of sulphanilic
acid mixed with one-third its bulk of nitric acid. The sulphanilic acid destroys any
free nitrous acid, which would otherwise exercise a bleaching action on the fuchsine-stained
bacilli. The sections may be counterstained with a solution of 0·5 Gm. of
methyl green (or 0·25 Gm. of methylene blue) in 20 C.c. of rectified spirit and 80 C.c.
of distilled water. Finally dehydrate in absolute alcohol, clear in cedar oil, and
mount in balsam.</p>

<h4>THE METRIC SYSTEM OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.</h4>

<p>The initial unit of the Metric System is the Metre or unit of length, which represents
one ten millionth part of the earth’s quadrant, or one forty-millionth part of the
circumference of the earth around the poles. The multiples and sub-divisions of this
and all the other units are obtained by the use of decimals, and for this reason the
system is also known as the <i>decimal system</i>. The multiples are designated by
the Greek prefixes, <i>deca</i> = 10; <i>hecto</i> = 100; <i>kilo</i> = 1000; <i>myria</i> = 10,000.
For the sub-divisions Latin prefixes are employed, as follows: <i>deci</i> = <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>;
<i>centi</i> = <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub>; <i>milli</i> = <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>1000</sub>. Thus for measures of length we have the following
expressions, showing the abbreviations commonly employed, and the equivalents in
the ordinary English standards of measurement&mdash;</p>

<p>The unit of weight in the metric system is the <span class="smcap">Gramme</span>. This is also derived from
the metre, and represents the weight of one cubic centimetre, of water, or the quantity
of distilled water, at its maximum density, 4&deg; C. (39·2&deg; F.), which would fill the cube
of one-hundredth part of a metre. The relative value of the gramme, together with
its multiples and sub-divisions, as compared with the English standards of weight,

<p>The expression <i>micro-millimetre</i> is used for microscopic measurements, and
denotes the thousandth part of a millimetre. Of the measures of capacity, the terms
most commonly employed are the litre and the cubic centimetre. Thus a decalitre may
also be expressed as 10 litres, a centilitre as 10 cubic centimetres, etc. Of the metric
weights the gramme and its fractional parts, with their respective prefixes, are much
used in analytical work. The kilogramme is largely employed in commercial transactions,
and is commonly abbreviated <i>kilo</i>.</p>

The cornea of the eye is not so entirely the simple transparent structure as it
at first sight may appear to be. It is composed of several layers, the most important
of which is the nerve layer, consisting of innumerable ganglionic stellate
plexus of cells held together by a network, as seen in <a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21</a>, a small section
stained by chloride of gold, and magnified 300 diameters. Beneath the nucleated
nerve cells is a second layer of stellate cells, varying a little in their form. These
nerve and stellate cells serve the purpose of maintaining the cornea in health, and
must play a significant part in the dioptric system.</p></div>

Diffraction effects may be observed without a microscope, indeed, the more
striking are seen in connection with telescopic vision. A beautiful series of
phenomena in illustration of the diffraction of light may be produced as follows:
Draw on a large sheet of paper a series of geometrical figures, arranged at equal
distances in a circle. A collodion photographic picture of these being taken, a
series of small transparent apertures in the elsewhere opaque film will result. This
film is then mounted, so that it may be in turn brought before the centre of a small
hand telescope, previously adjusted to view an image of the sun. In this way we
have an apparatus of the most compact form, and by means of which a series of
fifty or more phenomena may be brought into view in a few minutes. These
pictures being very small (occupying on an average area one-tenth of an inch in
diameter), inaccuracies of surface and substance of the glass may be neglected.
A film of Canada balsam with which the glass is cemented over the picture
produces no disturbance. There is a manifest advantage in the figures being
small, as the size of the image is in inverse proportion to the size of the
aperture.</p></div>

Professor Stokes wrote me in the following flattering terms:&mdash;“What you
have submitted to me on the subject of apertures is so sound, clear, and succinct,
that I have nothing to add to it. The method adapted as you have explained
respecting the immersion system, I consider to be perfectly satisfactory.” Subsequently,
and at my request, Sir George Stokes contributed a valuable paper on the
subject to the “Transactions of the Royal Microscopical Society,” 1876, on “The
Theoretical Limit of Aperture.”</p></div>

<i>Numerical aperture</i> is generally used in the sense in which it was introduced
in 1873 by Professor Abbe, on the basis of his theoretical investigations. Numerical
aperture represents the ratio between the radius of the effective aperture (<i>p</i>) of
the system on the side where the image is formed&mdash;more accurately the radius of
the emerging pencils measured in the upper focal plane of the objective&mdash;and the
equivalent focal length (<i>f</i>) of the latter, <i>i.e.</i>,</p>

<p class="copy">
Numerical aperture = <i>p</i>/<i>f</i>.
</p>

<p>This ratio is equal to the product of the sine of half the angle of aperture <i>u</i> of the
incident pencils and the refractive index <i>n</i> of the medium, situated in front of
the objective. With dry lenses <i>n</i> has therefore the value 1; with immersion lenses
it is equal to the refractive index of the particular immersion fluid:</p>

<p class="copy">
Numerical aperture = <i>n</i> Sin <i>u</i>.
</p>

<p>The numerical aperture of a lens determines all its essential qualities; the
brightness of the image increases with a given magnification and, other things
being equal, as the square of the aperture; the resolving and defining powers are
directly related to it, the focal depth of differentiation of depths varies inversely
as the aperture, and so forth. (Abbe, “The Estimation of Aperture,” “Journal
of the Royal Microscopical Society,” 1881, p. 389.)</p></div>

with caution; all minute details are lost, and it causes irregular shrinking of the
finer tissues, while fibrous tissue is brought into undue prominence at the expense
of the cellular elements. Consequently in certain biological laboratories the

Difficulties formerly associated with the microscopic examination of flagellate
forms of infusorial life have been overcome by improvements in the objectives,
by the knowledge gained of the monad groups, and by the exhaustive researches
of Drs. Drysdale and Dallinger, whose joint investigations were published
in the Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society, 1873-75. By employing the
highest and most perfectly constructed powers of the microscope, and devoting
an enormous amount of time and attention to unravelling mysteries so long
associated with the production of the lowly organised flagellate organisms, monads,
and patiently watching hour by hour, the life-history of numerous species of these
minute infusorial animalcules were obtained. Not only was it discovered that
these organisms increased indefinitely by fission, but that under certain conditions
two or more individuals were united into encystments, and whose contents broke
up into a greater or less number of spore-like bodies, were speedily developed
into the parent type. In the examination of these minute bodies, it has been
found that talc-films, that is, talc split into extremely fine lamin&aelig;, offer the best
kind of cover, in fact, supersede ordinary glass covers, and possess an advantage,
that of bending readily, thus permitting the objective to be brought close down
upon the object.</p></div>

situated at its origin; 2nd, of a nervous trunk running the entire length of

the ganglia of the internodes arising at this part; and 3rd, of a rich nervous
plexus resting on the trunk, and connecting the ganglia just mentioned, as
well as the basal ganglia of the individual polypides.” For further account, see

I have ventured to devote some considerable space to the development of the
pond-snail, and for an obvious reason, that of making it perfectly clear to my
readers that my microscopical investigations of Limnœa, made in 1853, were
published in the “Journal of the Microscopical Society,” June, 1854, and republished
in extenso in the several editions of this book, dating from the last mentioned
period. Nevertheless, the fringe of cilia was, it appears, rediscovered in 1874, just
twenty years after my paper was published. It is almost unnecessary to add that
Carpenter gravely errs in his statement “that the existence of the fringe of cilia
in the embryo snail had been overlooked until 1874.”</p></div>

Mr. George Rainey many years ago made us acquainted with the fact that
certain of the appearances presented by the shell or other hard structures of
animals, and which had hitherto been referred to as cell-development, are really
governed by the physical laws which govern the aggregation of certain crystalline
salts when exposed to the action of vegetable and animal substances in a state of
solution. Mr. Rainey furnished a process for obtaining artificially a crystalline
substance which shall so closely resemble shell structure that it can barely be
distinguished from it. The chemical substances to be used in the preparation of
the artificial shell, or calculi, are a soluble compound of lime and carbonate of
potash or soda, dissolved in separate portions of water, and mixed with some
viscid vegetable or animal substance, as gum or albumen, and mixing the several
solutions together. The mechanical conditions required are that such a quantity
of each of the viscid materials in each solution shall be of about the same density
as that of the nascent carbonate of lime, and at perfect rest. This state of rest will
require from two to three weeks or longer. Mr. Rainey shows the analogy or
identity of his artificially formed crystals with those found in natural products
both in animals and vegetables, chiefly confining himself to the structure and
formation of shells and bone, pigmental and other cells, and the structure and
development of the crystalline lenses, which he contends are all formed upon
precisely the same physical principles as the artificial crystals.</p></div>
